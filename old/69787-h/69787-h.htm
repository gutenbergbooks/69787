<div><h1>PREFACE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I have endeavoured in this book to make not only the story
but the teaching of the Buddha intelligible and human, so that
those who wish to understand one of the greatest facts in
history may not find themselves entangled in the mazes of
scholastic terms, and may perhaps be enabled to realize its
strange coincidences with modern psychology and certain
scientific verities. The teaching of the Indian Prince has
indeed nothing to dread from science. Sir Edwin Arnold’s
beautiful “Light of Asia” ends very early in that great ministry,
and I have continued the story to the death of the Buddha,
and have enriched it with many scriptures and ancient traditions
unknown to or unused by Sir Edwin. Words would fail
me if I attempted to express how necessary I think a knowledge
of this high faith and philosophy is to leaven the materialism
of the West, and the reception my books on cognate
subjects have had encourages me to think there may be those
who will see in what I here set down a great revelation of
truth. It is, at all events a truth which influenced not only
the mightiest thinkers of Greece and Rome, but also the
beginnings of Christian teaching—which it antedated by five
or six hundred years. It may well claim kindred with all the
great faiths, persecuting and opposing none which differ with
it, and this for reasons which are easily seen in the teachings
themselves. In relation to its noble and scientific austerity
no words are needed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the Founder himself, I may quote a great Buddhist
scholar’s opinion, one which none who have studied the subject
impartially will controvert. “Perhaps never while the world
has lasted has there been a personality who has wielded such
a tremendous influence over the thinking of humanity. And
whoso recognizes this will also recognize that almost two
and a half millenniums ago the supreme summit of spiritual
development was reached, and that at that distant time in
the quiet hermit groves along the Ganges already had been
thought the highest man can think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the august beauty of the Life those who read will form
their own judgment. It has been the mainspring of the highest
art of Asia. It has brought peace to myriads. It will bring it
to many more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have consulted all the available Scriptures, and have not
forgotten the great traditions. I am indebted to all the best
known scholars, including Max Müller, Faüsboll, Dahlke,
Rhys Davids, his accomplished wife, Beal, and many more.
I must mention Professor Radhakrishnan and other Indian
writers, and among illuminating thinkers I must not forget
Dr. Carus, and Mr. Edmond Holmes. To the latter’s work
I owe a debt because he appears to me to appreciate more
keenly than other writers the true point of junction between
the early and later interpretations of the Buddha’s teaching.
I have myself had the advantage of studying later Buddhist
interpretation with Japanese scholars, with whom I have
translated the Buddhist Psalms of Shinran Shonin. About
some of these interpretations there will always be points of
difference until we have access to the whole body of ancient
teaching in the Far East as well as in India, and freedom from
all error is beyond hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If any Buddhist scholars should look into this book they will
recall the immense difficulty of (so to speak) translating their
work for the public, especially where the words of one language
often fail to represent the thought of another. They
will therefore be lenient to shortcomings. They will note that
I have employed Pali or Sanscrit words and names alternatively
as I thought they would be more familiar or easier to remember.
<span class='it'>Karma</span> for <span class='it'>kamma</span>, and <span class='it'>Nirvana</span> for <span class='it'>Nibbana</span> are instances
of many others. I have omitted accents as mystifying
to those unfamiliar with Indian languages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I can scarcely hope to satisfy scholars and the general public.
But if I succeed in interesting some of the latter, the former,
will, I think, recognize that my aim was justified.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER I</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly two thousand five hundred years ago, in the
City of Kapila in Northern India, the spring came with
glory. And surely nowhere in all the three worlds is spring
more gracious, for the sunshine, life-giving, inspiring, draws
divine scents from moist earth and the deep luxuriance of leaves
and flowers to send on every breathing breeze pure incense
from the world, rejoicing as a bride in the all-enfolding delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here stood the little City of Kapila, nobly placed, as beseems
the birthplace of the Perfect One, and above it the Himalayas
stormed the skies with tossing billows of snow, leading the aspiration
of man on and up until it melted in the Divine. On
these, as was known, the Divinities had their dwelling.
Thence Indra, the heavenly lord, drove his flocks of clouds to
pasture in pure air, taking form and colour from the splendours
of the sun and the moon and the silver embroidery of the constellations.
Vaya, lord of the winds, charged in thunder or
breathed in music from awful heights of snow. Surya, the Sun,
urged his golden steeds from the low horizon to the zenith and
on to the confines of night. Chandra, the moon, rose on the
crest of the mighty range and sank below it into his mysterious
kingdom in the darkening west. The deep pine forests clothing
the lower spurs and veiling the sources of the rivers must surely
have their indwelling spirits, and the river Rohini, breaking
light-foot from the heights to scatter her diamonds as she
leaped from rock to rock or brooded a moment in deep pools
mirroring her ferns and flowers—what was she but a lovely,
living nymph, a Dancer, pure as the silver peaks that fathered
her? Therefore let it be known that this city was set among
celestial influences, that the gates of the Paradise of India were
not far from it, and that the Four Celestial Kings were its
wardens. And it dwelt at this time in a great peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The city and surrounding country, a part of the great kingdom
of Kosala, were inhabited by the Sakya clan. Very great
was the kingdom of Kosala. The vast and holy city of Benares,
a hundred miles south from Kapila, was but one of its
cities, and its capital, Savatthi, lay in the cloudy mountains
of Nepal. To the south-east lay the kingdom of Magadha,
and only the great Gods then knew to which of these kingdoms
would fall the sceptre of India.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And peaceful was the City of Kapila, the City of Red Earth,
home of the Sakya clansmen, a race strong and high, for they
were of the Arya, the Noble People, and it was they who descending
into India through the passes had conquered the dark
men of the land and driven them before them like the shadows
of night fleeing before the arrows of dawn; and having dispossessed
the dark-skinned, the lawless, the godless, the fair-skinned
Noble People entered in upon their lands and made
them theirs. With them the Noble People brought their Gods
of Heaven and Earth, and these they worshipped with sacrifice
and ritual and chanting of mantra and offerings of cows and
grain and ghi and all the savours dear to hovering divinity.
And in peace and plenty their Maharaja ruled them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very fair was the city on the banks of bright Rohini. As
there were few men of arrogant, dominant riches, so was there
no piercing poverty, and, since life was simple, all had enough.
The streets were clean-swept and watered, and parks and gardens
lay about them where men might shelter in the great heats
and the gay, golden-skinned children played beside the river
and grew sleek and round on their food of pure rice and plantains
and milk from the deep-dewlapped cattle that wound
home in the evenings from high pastures by running water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was there fare only for the body. Wise men, the Wanderers,
they whose minds are fixed on things unearthly and
whose souls climb toward keen stars as the cragsmen follow the
eagle to her eyry above the clouds, came in from mighty forests
where the hermits and their families dwell in peace with
God and man pursuing the purities of the householder’s life in
the wilds;—bringing with them the dreams, the speculations,
the conclusions of the hermits and themselves. And for such
the Raja had made a hall of cedarwood in the city, where
they might hold disputations with its wise men and the simpler
folk sit and listen, bestowing applause or condemnation as they
heard. For there was none in the city, gentle or simple, noble
or humble, but set the things of the spirit above the chaffer of
the market-place and lent a ready ear to such talk. Nor did
they fear to speak, for the Arya are free peoples, coming from
the north and bold and adventurous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And of these Wanderers the people learnt much, for if the
clansmen were free, these were freer. No love of earthly
homes or riches held them. Strip one of them of his worldly
all—his tattered robe and bowl for alms—and he would depart
content, smiling his strange, secret smile, as a man whose
treasure is beyond thief or destroyer. But for the <span class='it'>Wasa</span>, the
three months’ rainy season, they would stay, willing to speak
or to hear, satisfied with a very little, and when the sun shone
again, depart like migrating birds on their mysterious way.
And sometimes would come one, God-intoxicated, utterly heedless
of men, scarce emerging from <span class='it'>samadhi</span>, the mystic ecstasy;
and him would men surround with mute envy because in that
trance he beheld things not lawful nor possible to be uttered.
And such would stay but a little while and then, heedless of
rain or sun or wind or snow, press on to the cold glories of the
mountains, alone and in haste, and reappear no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So does the flame of the Divine draw the moth of the spirit
of man to hover about it until, dazzled and drunken with radiance,
it joins itself to the flame and is consumed into pure light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet was not the talk of the City of Kapila for ever of things
divine, for bygone Rajas and this one also (knowing that
where there is a North-man he must still be talking and much
trouble thereby averted) had made a Folk Mote, a meeting
hall, and not one only, where in the different quarters of the
town men might gather and talk of their affairs, the farmers
and handicraftsmen alike,—the sowing and harvesting of rice,
the well-doing of cattle, the doings of the Kosalans, of whom
they themselves were a clan, the subjugation of the swarthy natives
among whom they lay as pearls in a black ocean, the ambitions
of the Kings of Magadha, the trading of the merchants,
and many things more which concerned them nearly. And
each householder had the right to be heard, for each in his own
house was king and priest and there none might say him nay,
were it not that the Brahmans made or unmade his peace with
the Lords of Heaven through gifts and sacrifices and a ritual
grown exceedingly heavy and burdensome. But against these
even the fair-skinned people, the Arya, as they called themselves,
did not as yet dare to murmur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women of Kapila also were wives and mothers of free
men. Their faces were not veiled save when they themselves
for modesty chose to draw the folds between themselves and
too bold a gaze. They shared the joys and sorrows of their
men, though the great ladies were screened. And if they
walked in the ways of ritual piety even more eagerly and laid
daily gifts even more precious at the feet of the Brahmans, this
is the way of women all the world over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And these happy people had a good Maharaja, named Suddhodana,
or Pure Rice, because not only were his granaries and
those of his fathers’ before him full to overflowing, but his
heart was pure as the grains of living pearl; a man grave and
kind, rich also in cattle and elephants, yet not arrogant with
riches, charitable, alms-giving, reverencing the Brahman and
the ascetic, walking in peace in the way of ancient pieties, with
thoughts of his own to think as he raised his eyes to the mountains,
awful in the heavens as intermediaries between men and
Gods. And he had taken to wife two fair sisters, the elder,
Maya, the younger, Prajapati; and by the elder, the more
dearly loved, had as yet no child and by neither a son to succeed
him on his peaceful seat of rulership. And this was a
grief to him, for when he was gone who should sacrifice to his
soul and the souls of the great dead fathers? Very sweet and
grateful is the tenderness of daughters, but this they cannot do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And one day, as they sat in the pleasure pavilion beside the
waters of Rohini, listening to her song of the snows as she
danced onward, downward from the heights, the Maharaja
Suddhodana opened his heart once more to his wives. And
one, Maya the Maharani, sat at his feet on a cushion of silk
woven with gold, and her beauty was calm as the evening star
shining in a faint moonlight, luminous, remote, veiled with
dreams and hopes unknown to others. The second Queen,
Prajapati, was fair and gentle, and no more—yet that is much,
as shall be shown. And these two were sisters in heart as in
blood and wifehood. So, laying his hand on the head of
Maya, the Maharaja spoke softly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What dreams my Queen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she, pointing to the bamboo grove where stood in green
slim hand clasping her sister’s:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of motherhood. Of this I dream night and day, knowing
many beautiful things, but most of all this—that the heart of
my lord, my beloved, cannot rest until a son of his is laid in
his arms. O would, if I am barren, that my heart’s sister, my
Prajapati, might give to our husband this gift of gifts!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he, with heavy brows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear lady and wife, the Gods give and withhold their great
gift of life at pleasure. What have we left undone? We have
besought them. We have offered of our best on many an altar.
We have fed Brahmans, we have kept the precepts, and yet—they
do not give. If in some former life we have sinned—Yet
who can tell? It is their will, and must be borne even if
it break my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Prajapati, raising her sweet eyes timidly to him, one
slim hand clasping her sister’s:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If my lord please to take another wife, then indeed my
sister and I will serve her, and if a son is born, what can we
but rejoice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That son would not be the child of my Queens, and most of
all of Maya, the Great Lady. Dear he might be, but not so
dear; and, moreover, you both, my ladies, have heard the word
of the wandering Rishi, the wise ascetic, who prophesied that
in this city, in this fortunate palace, should a child be born, a
ruler of men, a King among Kings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it be here and now!” said the lady Maya. And
again, softly: “May we be found worthy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long silence and only Rohini, the river, talked
of sweet secret things as she went her way. And presently
the Maharaja added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it will not be!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a large tear pearled itself on the long lashes of Prajapati
and spilt down the bloom of her cheek as she watched her
baby daughter in the arms of a dark-skinned nurse lulling her
to sleep with strange and wistful songs of the native people,
by the lotuses on the great marble tank in the shade of the
pippalas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And presently the evening came, gliding with silent steps
through the woods and along the waters, veiled as a maid who
steals to meet her star-eyed lover. And having beheld the
pomps of sunset, the mountains withdrew into their mysteries
and a star stood on each of their summits for guard, and in a
great peace the moon floated upward, resplendent. Then the
beauty of heaven and earth became marvellous and remote,
and the earth was no longer for men but Gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that night Maya, the Great Lady, asleep beside her lord
in the pleasure pavilion when moonlight blanched the dewy
lawns like snow, dreamed a dream. Nor was it the first.
This lady was vision-haunted. Her eyes, her ears, were open
to all the starry influences to all the weeping of winds and the
tales the reeds whisper to one another in lonely places. But
this dream came, not flitting ghostly along the ways of sleep
nor with the morning dissolving cloud-like, illusive, scarcely to
be grasped or recorded, more a feeling than a thought, but clear,
majestic, terrible and beautiful, so that she found herself (and
knew not how) sitting up, awake, aware, breathless, as it were
a Queen to whom has been made a great annunciation from
equal powers. And, with an awakening hand laid upon her
husband, she spoke, nor did her voice tremble:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beloved, awake! I have dreamed. For it seemed to me
that the four Guardian Divine Kings lifted me from my bed
and bore me away to the great mountains and laid me down.
And heavenly spirits, shining as stars, came about me and
bathed me in the pure waters of a mountain lake, freeing me
of all human stain. And when this was done they laid me
down again, clothing me in the gold of divine garments and
shedding perfumes about me. And I saw a lordly elephant,
white as silver, wandering beneath the trees. For, as you
know, this is the symbol of royalty. And touching me on the
right side with his trunk, he appeared to melt into a cloud and
pass like a vapor into my womb. In the darkness I have seen
a great light shine, and in the air myriads of radiant spirits
sang my joy. And O, beloved, all is well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he stammering, amazed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beloved, when you awaked me, the music of these very
spirits rang in my ears, and they cried to me with voices more
tunable than all songs of birds or harmony of well-touched
lutes, ‘The child shall be born when the Flower-Star shines in
the east.’ And as you touched me, I awoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And more they could not say, but clung to each other, trembling
for joy and wonder. Nor could any sleep come to them
that night, for in their gladness it seemed they stood on the
shining shores of heaven, its light about them like an ocean.
And when on the morrow these dreams were told to Prajapati,
she rejoiced with them, no thought of envy to cloud the crystal
of her soul. And when they were laid before the dream-readers,
they could presage nothing but good, and being called
in before the Maharaja where he sat in state with his Maharanis,
they spoke as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lord of men shall be born, a great and awful ruler. Let
the soul of the Maharaja be exalted, and the heart of the
Maharani rejoice and triumph, since to their house is given a
son whose kingdom is the earth and the fullness of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Maharaja shouted for joy, while Maya the Maharani,
listened with dreaming eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For he shall conquer the earth!” he cried, “and the trampling
of his elephants be heard like thunder, and Kosala shall
be his kingdom and Maghada prostrate before his feet, and
riches and glory shall be the slaves of the Conqueror for ever
and ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Maharani said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For ever and ever? Yet there is death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Prajapati hid her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the dream-readers, looking up with reverence where
they knelt before their diagrams and circles, answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Lady, there are riches that Death cannot thieve.
There are conquests that Time does not triumph over.
There is an Empire that passes not away. What the fate of
this child is to be we cannot yet tell. It bewilders us, for
great and auspicious as are the signs, they are not plain reading
as is the custom. It may be that the child shall be a sage,
dominating the souls of men, ruling by pure wisdom, a conqueror——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But here the Maharaja broke in, in anger:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be silent, for this I will not have! The men of my race
are Kshatriyas, warriors. The Brahman, the ascetic, the hermit,
have their sacred uses, and may the guardian Gods
forbid that I should disparage their merit—but my son is my
son and a warrior, and if the signs are great, it is a warrior’s
greatness I claim for him, for in my family is no other known
or considered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But still the dream-readers lingered in doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great sir, there is more to be told, strange and very wonderful.
Two ways lie before the child to be, and in which he
will walk we cannot say. If, when he is of age to judge, he
beholds a sick man, an old man, a dead man, and a holy monk,
then great and wide is his kingdom but not of this world. And
if he see not these signs, he shall be a king of the earth, magnificent
in riches, glory and power. Therefore it is in the
hand of his father to choose what he shall see or not see. The
dream is read.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gladly and gloriously is it read!” shouted the Maharaja.
“No such sights shall my son see. Leave spiritual things to
spiritual men, for he shall reign for ever and ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And bowing, with minds perplexed, the dream-readers
gathered up their calculations and departed. And in the city
they spread their news, and there was scarcely a man but
thought and rejoiced with the Maharaja, commending him in
that he chose rather to have a son to fight beside him and ride
terribly at his bridle rein than an ascetic in the woods, with
matted hair and clawed hands, to pray for his victories——“So
would we all choose, like men!” they said. And very joyful
was the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maya the Great Lady, saying little, went her way in
peace, strong and calm of purpose as our general mother the
earth, pure within and without as the white lotus; and surrounding
herself with a great tranquillity, she floated on its
surface as a water-lily, rooted in the life-giving bosom of earth,
turning an adoring face to the purities of the heavens and absorbing
their radiance, until her heart was pure gold and her
body white as the ivory of the flower that is a prayer embodied
and throne of all the Gods. And if she passed through the
city, the women and children strewed flowers before her as before
a goddess borne in procession, and when the benediction
of her eyes fell on them, they prostrated themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And always her sister, Prajapati, went beside her, guarding
her with her own hands, treasuring her as a thing already enskied
and sainted, a fear in her heart clasping hands with joy.
And the Maharaja Suddhodana would stride into the pavilion,
saying in his great voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wife, how goes it? For the time passes onward, and soon
the spring shall be here again, and with it our boy. This day
have the farmers given me a little plough, made of red cedarwood,
banded with ivory, and when he can walk and talk he
shall plough his furrow like a man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she, smiling, answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear lord, he shall plough his furrow and sow his seed,
and very great shall his harvest be. All goes better than well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again another day he came with a sword, the haft
sparkling like frost with jewels, and he cried, rejoicing:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This have the goldsmiths and handicraftsmen of the city
given me, that with it my son may strike off the head of the
goat for his first sacrifice, and after destroy his enemies as
when Indra thunders and lightens from the peaks. But is all
well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she, smiling:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beloved, his enemies shall fall before him like chaff driven
on a gale. And all goes better than well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she spent her time in deep meditation, free from grief
or pain, free also from illusions and desires, in a measureless
content and foreseeing. Thus the time went by, not swiftly
as a dancer nor slowly as a mourner, but in a great quiet, pacing
with majesty from day to day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, on a certain day when Spring with her birds and blossoms
was come to earth, the Maharani, following the custom
of the ladies of her race, with her sister made ready all her
matters and entered the presence of her husband, speaking
thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear lord, it is a habit of my people that when our children
are born it is in the house of our parents. Have I then
your permission to journey to them for this auspicious birth,
that, returning, I may bring my sheaves with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he, embracing her with true affection, gave her leave
to go, commending her to the care of Prajapati and giving strict
command that men should go before making all the ways clear
for her litter, and men and women be warned that no sight
painful or terrifying should meet her eyes. So, tenderly invoking
the prayers and ritual of the Brahmans on her and
his son’s behalf, he sent her forth and returned to his duties
full of thought. But she, borne in her litter and embraced in
the very arms of peace, went her way, thinking to reach the
house of her parents and knowing not that the great hour of
her life was even then upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And passing the Lumbini gardens, where trees and flowers,
placid waters and green shades, the song of birds and cooing
of doves combine to make a heaven on earth, she commanded
them to stay her litter that she might set her feet in the sun-warmed
grass and stand beside the coolness of the lake. So it
was done, and leaning on the arm of Prajapati, she descended
and entered the garden and wandered awhile, silent for joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly, as they stood beneath a great palsa tree,
sweeping the sward with robes of green and the honeyed snow
of blossom, awe and trembling seized her and a measureless
marvelling; and the tree swept its boughs earthward until the
leaves and flowers lay thick upon the grass, and she knew that
the life of all growing things and of the divine earth and the
mountains and skies lived within her and that her hour was
come. So she laid her hand on a bough of the palsa tree, and
as Prajapati knelt beside her, stilled with joy and fear, and her
women crowded outside the close blossomed shelter of the
palsa tree, her son was born: not like a human birth with
agony but painlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, it was told afterwards that for wardens the Four
Heavenly Kings stood about him, and that the air was
thronged with those birds of heaven, the happy Shining Ones,
singing and rejoicing. And it is told that throughout the
world all polluted streams flowed clear as crystal, and that
even as the lady his mother suffered no pang of childbirth, so
all sentient creatures knew surcease of pain because of that
great Birth and rejoiced with her in jungle and meadow, in
deep waters, and in clouds aerial—for what mother or child
could sorrow in that hour?</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>B</span><span class='sc'>ut</span> of the child, what shall be said? Borne back to
the palace with flute and drum, through streets
thronged with eager men and women pressing forward
to behold him, he did not sleep, nor shrink, like other
children, but gazed about him as though the gem of thought
were hidden beneath the blue deeps of his eyes. He shone like
pure gold, after the manner of his people, Aryan, noble, a child
of high descent. And it is told that the hidden sweetness of
precious lilies went with him and that the garments of shining
spirits, sweeping unseen above him, made the air vibrant. So
the Maharaja, receiving him in his arms, blessed his son, rejoicing
in his happy fate who was the father of such a one as
the world could not show the like. And in his ears the voices
of prophecy made a changing music of pride and triumph.
And the Maharani, overweighted with gladness, like a lily surcharged
with dew, was borne to her noble couch of ivory and
gold; and Prajapati watched each breath she drew, so great
were her love and fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, to the rejoicing palace, came an ascetic of pure life
and understanding, a dweller on the holy heights of Himavat,
a great marvel-worker, honoured of all men; and he desired to
enter the presence of the Maharaja and make obeisance. And
this was granted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bowing before the Maharaja, he addressed him thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great sir, as I came on the sun’s way, I heard the rejoicing
of radiant spirits in the air, and when I asked why they were
glad, they triumphed in this verse—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“ ‘The Wisdom-Child, that precious Jewel, unmatched, unrivalled,</p>
<p class='line0'>Is born in Lumbini, in the land of the happy Sakyas,</p>
<p class='line0'>For good and joy to all the world of men.’</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore am I come. Lead me now to the young child that
I may see him and be glad also. Rejoice, O Maharaja of
happy fortune, for most surely is it owing to your righteous
deeds in former lives that this good celestial is fallen to your
lot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Maharaja, dumb with love and pride, led the way
to the palace hall where the child slept; and they uncovered
his little lovely person that the old man might see and be glad
also. So he considered the precious marks and signs of his
body, assuring him to be a Buddha, one perfect in enlightenment,
reading and comprehending them all with a heart that
scarce for joy could believe what lay before him. And, seeing
these wonderful birth-portents, the tears rolled down his
cheeks; and at his weeping fear seized the father, and he bowed
down at the ascetic’s feet, crying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O what is my lord’s grief: O what are his tears? Is the
child doomed? Do we lose him? Forbid it, all-seeing Divinities!
Forbid it that one parched, within reach of the
eternal draught, should lose all and perish of thirst! Forbid
it that I should lose my treasure! For when a man dies who
owns a son, it is as a man with two eyes—one sleeps yet the
other watches,—but a man without a son is blind in death’s
darkness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the ascetic, seeing his grief, answered swiftly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, have no fear. Good and better than good are the portents.
I wept for myself. This child shall rule the world,
but I, by reason of my age, shall not live to see it. Deep and
full and wide is the river of his Law. Like a great lake is the
calm of his Yoga; like the sun at the zenith his wisdom. The
earth shall be glad for him, and he shall reign and he SHALL
reign, and mighty the glory of his dominion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And having said this, the ascetic departed mysteriously,
after the fashion of the Instructed, leaving joy as his gift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But still Prajapati watched by the Queen Maya and leaned
her ear close to catch a whisper—for as yet the Great Lady
had not spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the child lay in the hollow of her arm, and it was
the seventh day. And without raising her lashes, she whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister, my true sister! On the seventh day I die, for
so it is with those mothers whose joy, too great for the lowlands
of earth, soars like a bird to the mountains of heaven. My
joy is winged. No more can it walk beside my sweet sister
nor follow my husband as his shadow nor guard the steps of
my child. It is become divine. Already its wings quiver for
flight. But all is well. My place is prepared in a heaven
where my bliss, rolling outward, may spread into a sea to mirror
the Wisdom I have borne. And you, my true sister, will not
forget me, but, taking this child for your own, will nourish him
with noble milk from your pure bosom. And for our lord you
will take heed. And this I know, that the Way of Peace shall
be opened to the feet of my son’s foster-mother as to mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Prajapati pressed her cheek against the Great Lady’s
in silence that laid a finger on the lips of grief, and the child
slept between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Night, with the moon in her hair and the stars for ear
and breast jewels, came gliding down from the high mountains
and wandered in the palace gardens, shedding sleep unutterable
and all sweet influences from her outspread hands. And
there was not one in the palace, from the Maharaja to the
sweeper but slept, dreaming auspicious dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in the morning all woke refreshed and at peace. But
Maya, the Great Lady waked not. And her sister, the Queen
Prajapati, seeing the child, lovely as an image of pure gold,
blue-eyed and beautiful, loved him, and took him to her
fragrant bosom, and became his mother. And he received the
name of Siddhartha, meaning “He who has attained his aim”—for
who could doubt that such a child must conquer where he
would?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this child all good came to the City of Kapila and
to the country round about, and all the Sakya clansmen
prospered very greatly. Their cows were pure-coloured, well-proportioned,
giving fragrant and rich milk with even flow;
their horses were as though winged, shaped for speed and
strength; their elephants royal beasts and understanding.
When rain was needed the air distilled it seasonably, and the
five cereals swelled with scented grain, wholesome and soft for
food. All creatures about to produce their young were content
and at ease, their bodies well-knit and healthful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was this grace confined to the lower creation, for in the
City of Kapila and its dominions, amongst men and women
auspicious things grew like seed flung from the hands of Gods,
and even those whom their passions spurred down the broad
way of a dangerous karma, considered and took heed, and, laying
aside their selfish desires and covetousness, thought no
proud, envious thoughts, but lived in quiet with their neighbours;
and men were grave and recollected and women chaste
and calm, and by all were the Four Rules of Purity honoured.
And it is told that the Maharaja, seeing this heavenly guest
within his palace, for his sake dwelt purely, practising virtue,
putting away from him all evil company, that his heart might
not be polluted with lust. And he meditated much by night
and day, drinking the moon’s brightness with clasped hands and
sacrificing in the golden silences of the dawn, when all high influences
are unloosed. And this course of conduct must ensue
from such a birth, for, as the lotus and champak flowers exhale
their perfume and the moon drops camphor in her secret
glories, so do the influences of purity and high thought spread
outward from the person of a Buddha-to-be. Therefore, as
the light of sun or moon increases little by little and none can
measure its growth, so was it with the child, orbing into beauty
perfect and yet more perfect—if such a thing can be. And
with precious things they surrounded him. Noble amulets
guarded his person, great gems adorned him, and the scent of
sandalwood made sweet the air for his breathing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, when the time for instruction came, the Maharaja considered
whom he should employ to teach his son. Should it
be a man of the Wanderers, who, having cast the world utterly
aside, scans its wisdom with the diamond ray of perfect comprehension—one
of the Unfettered? Or should it be one of
the men of braided hair—a Brahman hermit, held, as yet, in
family ties, but living the life of pure contemplation? Or a
bearer of the Triple Staff?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much he revolved these matters and, gathering opinions,
digested them, and summoned to the high task the wise and
saintly Viswamitra. And the boy was brought before him and
made due obeisance to his teacher (who is, if possible, more to
be reverenced than even a father, being the father of the soul
and mind, whereas that other may be but the father of the
transitory body); but when Viswamitra questioned the noble
child, it has been told that there was nothing he did not know
already. For it is related that he was familiar with all that
has been written in books or told with tongues, even from the
number of the spheres and heavenly bodies, as also their triangular,
square and sextile aspects, to the powers of the lowliest
worm that creeps upon the earth, unable even to raise its
head to adore the divine luminaries. There was nothing that
teacher could teach him, for already he knew all. So Viswamitra
heard and trembled, and at last, seeing that this matter
touched on things deep, incomprehensible and wonderful, he
prostrated himself before the child, and, closing up his books,
went his way marvelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet let it not be thought that the Maharaja Suddhodana
could behold these portents with a heart of ease, for mingled
with all his pride and joy was fear. His son moved before
him, beautiful exceedingly, perfect in duty not only to his
father and his foster-mother, Prajapati the fair and noble, but
also to all with whom he had to do, quick to smile and reply,
glad in a boy’s sports and games, and yet—apart. As a man,
looking down through the clear crystal of a lake, may behold
beneath it groves of strange leafage where silver fish dart and
disappear in a life unknown to him, so the Maharaja, looking
through the translucence of his son’s eyes uplifted to his, knew
that they revealed yet hid a world in which he had no part.
And this aloofness grew to be to him a knife driven into his
very heart. And time passed, and the child became a noble
youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day the Maharaja sent for his minister, an old man,
wise and instructed, and to him he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is all well in the city and the country about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the old minister, saluting, replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Maharaj, all is well. And since the birth of your auspicious
son how could it be otherwise? For it appears that
in past times when a child of pure brilliancy was born, there
prevailed great prosperity, and wickedness came to an end.
And so it is now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, sighing as if his heart were like to break, the Maharaja
replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is true. And who should rejoice more than I? Yet
it is not so, and my heart is consumed with anxiety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the minister remained respectfully silent, and the Maharaja
continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For my son is not as the other young nobles, free and gay
and enamoured of sports and battle and women, but the opposite—rather
enduring than sharing the frolics suited to his age;
and when I see him meditating beneath the rose-laurels and
mark his calm, abstracted eyes, it recalls to me the saying of
the sage Asita, that ‘embarking in the boat of wisdom, he
shall save the world from peril.’ Now, were this to be the
wisdom of a great King delivering his people, I might triumph
as I did in hearing it, but if it is to be the cold wisdom of the
Wanderers and forest-dwellers, then I desire none of it, for to
embark in that boat is to be severed from power and from all
things dear and desirable to the heart of man. What, then, is
your counsel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with grief written in his face, the aged minister replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great sir, who shall challenge Fate and the unwritten laws
of the Divine? I will own that sometimes in the noble youth’s
presence I have felt as it were a cold air blowing between him
and me, as though he stood apart from lesser men. And more
than once this thought has occurred: Suppose this noble Siddhartha
is a Bodhisattva, destined in his next re-birth to be a
Buddha, how then shall we fight against a destiny so great
and awful? But yet it may not be thus, and so rarely does a
Buddha appear upon the earth that there is neither experience
nor knowledge to guide us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, trembling, the Maharaja replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You voice my very fear. It is certain that many of the
predictions which my soul applied to earthly glory, may be
read otherwise if considered. But since I dread this unspeakably
and we are by no means certain of the end, what is your
counsel that we may divert him and so fulfil his mind with
beauty and bliss, that these cold visions may blow away like
mists at sunrise and leave him glad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, smiling subtly, the old man answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is one way, and one only. For it is acknowledged
throughout the three worlds that there is no charm of forgetfulness
like the beauty of a woman. On her bosom the Gods
are forgotten and the wisdom of the wise is vanity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Maharaja, with impatience:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is true of others, but as for my son, he has seen the
loveliest face to face and has never turned to look again.
Think better, old man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the noble, a noble bait. And there is a girl, daughter
of the great Suprabuddha, young and lovely as the Maiden
of the Dawn when she stands, rose-fingered, smiling upon the
mountain peaks, and this maiden is pure in health and person,
constant and faithful, cheerful evening and morning, one to
establish the palace in purity and quiet, full of dignity and
grace. Among her companions she moves as the queen-swan
leading the flotilla, with stately neck, yet bowed in humility.
For a King of all the earth this is a fitting consort. I have
made diligent inquiry. Her name is Yashodara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Maharaja replied with joy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this Yashodara may be our deliverance! Send in
haste, but with dignity, to Suprabuddha her father, and call a
gathering at which the bridegroom-to-be shall show his
strength with bow and sword and horse against all rivals, after
the manner of the free choice of our women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the old man bowed and went away, smiling, but with a
sore doubt at his heart—for he also recalled the words and
portents of the Prince’s birth and dreaded the anger of awful
Gods if any should let their purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus on a certain day the lists were set, and the Sakya
lords were challenged by the noble Siddhartha to archery, to
sword-play and to riding, that the maiden, Yashodara, might
know she chose no craven to be her husband. And all
the people crowded to see, some wagering on the success of this
lord and some on that, but all, on whomsoever they wagered,
hoping that the son of the good Maharaja might win honour
and the bride. Yet most believed that the victor would be
Devadatta, cousin of Siddhartha, a young prince proud and obstinate
and amorous and very skilful in feats of arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the golden silence of very early morning when the
people crowded to the <span class='it'>maidan</span> where all should be done, for the
heat of the later day forbade it then. So still was it that not
a frond of the palms stirred nor even a bamboo leaf lifted on
the air, and the dew lay bright as silver upon grass and
flower. So still that the voice of Rohini, full-throated from the
melting snows, would have filled the quiet but for the myriad
shufflings of bare feet through the dust and the tinkle of litter
bells as the hidden beauty and her companions were borne to
the place of meeting. For her face should not be seen until
she made her choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all the way was strewn ankle-deep with flowers, as
though the Spirits of the Air had rained them with both hands
upon the glad earth, and from their bruised beauty was shed
such sweetness on the dew that the fragrance rose like incense
to greet the lovely ones on their way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the rival lords rode on to the <span class='it'>maidan</span> in splendour
of armour jewelled and inlaid with gold and swords that
flashed like lightning from the rifts of cloudy mountains, and
horses that seemed to spurn the ground with their hoofs and
desire to ride the air like the very coursers of the sun, then
the joy of the people so grew that they clapped their hands and
shouted lustily, for of all things the noble fair-skinned Northern
peoples love a good man and a good horse, and only next to
these a beautiful woman. And of the last the most beautiful
as yet was hidden. So they shouted until their voices were
like the noise of a great wind and the echoes returned them
from far-off heights and woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Devadatta rode a horse so black that in the night he
seemed a part of it, but Siddhartha’s horse was white, proud
and great and gentle, and his name shall not be forgotten while
the round world holds, for he was Kantaka—and of him more
hereafter. And when the maiden, looking between the curtains
of her palanquin so that none might know she looked,
saw the young Sakya lord, her heart left her bosom and fled
into his, settling there like a bird nestling with feet and wings,
for there was none like him—none. With calm he sat his
horse, awaiting the moment, and young he was and slender
and like an image of pure gold, and his eyes were blue and dark
after the manner of his people, and his lips and cheek shaped
by a great graver. He carried his head as a stag in the spring
season, and for all his slenderness was he tense and eager as
a bow in the hand of the Brahma King with the arrow laid
on the string. And so he waited, and his eyes never sought
the palanquin where was hidden the Pearl of Victory. And
to her sick heart she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is not mine! He is above me. What woman can cloud
the serenity of those eyes? How can the fiery dart of Madhu,
the God of Love, pierce that breast, guarded with the snow of
high thoughts? He is a King too high for me—too high.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it is true that the noble youth thought little of the
maiden, but much of the great clash with his rivals, for he
knew well that Honour was the prize of the day and that his
father’s heart must needs break if he failed before all the Kin
of the House and the people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it is certain that of this jousting many tales have grown
up, of arrows flying miraculously, winged by eager Gods, of
sword-strokes such as the world has never seen nor shall see,
of horses that the Wind, Vaya himself, might bestride for
swiftness and cruel, dangerous pride. And how all this may
be I know not, who was not there; but this I know, that Siddhartha
was better than the best in all the tests, and that the
people stormed and shouted and laughed and wept, knowing
not what they did so only they might hail him conqueror, while
he stood leaning on his sword, breathing lightly and resting, for
the first time smiling, a very splendid young knight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Maharaja, scarcely daring to look in his son’s face
lest he should too openly show his pride and joy, said only:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son, you have done well.” And, turning, “Bring forth the
bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then all the people were of a sudden silent, that not a word,
not a sound of that Beautiful should be lost. And they drew
back the pictured curtains of the litter and she stepped forth,
most resembling the silver moon floating through clouds to her
unveiling and pure radiance, and so stood before the people,
clad in supple silver that flowed about her like water and jewels
that dripped glory braided among the silk-soft hair that fell to
her ankles and crowned her brows. (Yet none could look
at her splendour, for her face drew the bees of all glances to
the honey of its sweetness and there held them, dizzy with
ecstasy.) Thus, with a maiden, only less fair, on either side,
she paced towards Siddhartha where he sat motionless on his
white horse as a man of marble, carrying in her hand the Garland
of Choosing. And coming before him, she raised her
eyes to his and stood silent; but her look pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then for the first time he knew in the solitude of his heart
the drawing near of another. And soft spring airs came before
her, with the singing of mating birds, and pearling of young
buds and delicate tremble and thrill of life in green silences
and all the good things of this world. And it troubled his
calm, because he knew not what it meant, and it was more
pain than pleasure. This sweet melody, as it were of flutes
and lutes, that came from the tattling of her anklets and the
rustle of her garments, overpowered the austere, high voices
that had breathed in his ear from birth, and they were silent.
Like a man bewildered, he dismounted from white Kantaka,
with his arm still laid along the noble neck, and gazed down
upon her, and their looks met and were one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she stooped and took the dust from his feet, then rising,
stately as a young palm-tree, she put the Garland of Choosing
about his neck and together they faced the shouting people
and the rivals, some sullen as Devadatta the evil-hearted, some
glad in the victory as Ananda the Prince, his true cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And of all men who saw that sight be sure that none more
beautiful could ever meet their eyes than the silver bride hand
in hand with the golden lover, shining as Surya the Sun rejoicing
to run his course; for with the touch of her hand, doubt
dropped from him like a garment and they were submerged,
he and she alike, in the joy of the bridegroom and the bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Maharaja, laughing aloud for triumph and gladness,
said to the old minister:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have caught our bird! Thanks be to the God of
Love!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the old man replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great sir, it will need the triple cord of love to bind him—your
own, the wife’s and the child’s. Let us wait. Still are
we not secure.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time went by, but since he had snared his bird, the
Maharaja Suddhodana resolved that the fetters should
be gilded, and calling his minister again, he said to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a man would cage a bird of heaven (and such, I think, is
my son), it is necessary that earth should be made heaven, so
that no home-sickness for the blue heights should take him.
And because a young man may weary of one woman’s beauty,
however beautiful, let fresh faces be found to make for him a
wreath of such roses of the earth as may intoxicate him with
its love and perfume. Send north to Savatthi and south to
Benares, and fetch such beauties, such players on the vina and
sitar as sing before the high Gods, such dancers as those whose
white limbs, melting to music, enchant their eyes. Give orders
to build him a house for the winter, when the snow is blue in
the hollows of Himalaya and the rivers are locked in his cold
heart. See that it be warm and silent and that no wind may
creep in, and let white furs of snow-leopards, clouded with
black, lie about it, soft and smooth to the touch, and let there
be story-tellers to speed the long nights with jest and amorous
tale and clash of battle. Shut out the cold and terrible moon
with close lattice-work and rich curtains, for she, remote and
small in the blue, profound skies, may freeze his soul to the
chill calm I fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the minister, saluting, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All shall be done. And yet——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet there is more before we may sleep in peace.
Build for him also a house of spring. Let it be pavilioned,
and with little stiff, frilled roofs flying outward like the skirts
of a dancer when she revolves swiftly. On every point set a
wind-bell to resemble her anklets and armlets in their tinkling,
so that the soft breezes from the hills shall make an aerial
music as they wander about it. Let it appear as if the whole
were blown together like a cloud on a wind and might be
lifted and dispersed like thistle-down—a dream of spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the old wise man saluted, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be done. And yet——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet it is not enough,” mused the Maharaja, stroking
his great beard. “For we must build also a house for summer—to
drowse in, dim and cool and with long echoing colonnades
to catch the faintest breath of breeze. Let this house be
set in the grass by Rohini, that her liquid voice may sing of
the snows when the dog-days are sultry. And let it be paved
with shining stone from the mountains, and the walls be of
dark cedar, carved wonderfully, and all the windows dimmed
and latticed that the heats die on the threshold. Choose a
place for it where the asoka trees are deep with rich leafage
and golden blossom, and the neems spread their shade and the
acacias rain white petals and the champak swoons in its heavy
sweetness. Let there be a lake, pensive with reeds and green
reaches, the haunt of swans and cranes and all beautiful water
birds, and silver rills by which my son may sit and muse if he
will, until the langour of slowly dropping water shall pass into
his veins and be a narcotic binding him for ever to long dreaming
days and nights, and he be utterly content.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the old man saluted, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it shall be done. Is it also your pleasure, Maharaja,
that I set a guard at the gate of the park of the three Pleasure
Houses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my pleasure. And now I will visit my son’s wife and
hear her mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he went to the place of the women in the great house.
And his presence being told to Yashodara, she came before
him, sweet as the star of evening bathed in rosy vapours, for a
dress fell about her coloured as though dipped in the blood of
red roses and bound with gold that, winding spirally upward
round her lovely limbs and bosom, embraced them, drawing
the eye to the slender curves, and she wore no jewels but only
the great rings in her ears sparkling with fiery gems. And he
drew her to his feet and she sat on a cushion beside him, looking
upward with duty and affection, waiting for the favour of
his speech. And at last, having observed the delicate sweetness
of her face and her grace and majesty, he said, sighing:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noble daughter, you have now been wedded to my son,
Siddhartha, for six months. Is all well with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, stooping to touch his feet, she replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great father, all is well. And I did not know that in all the
world there was such joy as I share night and day with my dear
lord. For beyond all beauty he is beautiful and beyond all
goodness, good, and his gentleness of speech is not like that of
a woman, but with strength behind it like Himalaya when he
smiles in sunshine. And yet——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words stopped like hovering birds on her sweet lips
and her fine brows drew together as she meditated. And the
Maharaja, drawing his hand from her head, leaned forward
to look into her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daughter, have you a doubt—and what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She, lovely and submissive, made haste to answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great lord, all is pure joy, and yet——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he, in great anger, so that she shrank down, veiling her
face with her hands:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet! When I command my minister to surround my
son with all joy wherewith to bind and hold him, he obeys, but
ends always with ‘And yet—’ as though some mystery surrounded
him! And you, that should triumph in pride and
joy, say the like. My son is fair and free and noble and
sharer in my riches and pride. What is this miserable ‘And
yet—’ that mocks my hope? Speak out, woman, and tell me
what is in your heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, kindling her courage at his sternness, the wife of Siddhartha
looked at him with clear, unsullied eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, all I have said is truth, but there is also this. In
the midst of rejoicings of song and when the women dance
before him and the feast is spread and the great fruits, cooled
with snow, and purple wines in cut crystal cups are set to his
hand, then often I know that though his fair body is among us,
his soul is escaped and fled away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in her eyes two tears gathered and stood but did not
fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he, with anger:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would it not be thought a woman should know her business!
For what is beauty but to hold a man prisoner to the
senses? And you are beautiful as the woman the high Gods
made with flowers—how then do you fail? Does he not love
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, he loves me. But not me only. He loves something
that I know not, and his thought flies away to it as a dove flies
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, true! It is true. What is this thing? For I, too,
have felt it. When I have spoken of wealth and power and
pride, I have known that as you, daughter, say, his soul is escaped
and gone, I cannot tell where. But have no fear. Tell
me only this—has never a word, never a sight of sorrow crept
into the paradises I have made for him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not one. All is joy unceasing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And no sign of age, of sickness, of death? For, as I have
told you, he must not know that these things are, and until
he passed into your keeping, the secret was well guarded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she replied gravely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The secret is well guarded. He does not know. When he
speaks, it is of an eternity of delight and of nothing else. And
yet—if I may speak and live——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak. Even in the words of women there is sometimes
wisdom, and you are a pearl among women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great lord, is it possible to strive against the high Gods?
For they have appointed death and sickness and grief to be
our lot, and it may be that the very joy of life is the greater
because we know it is brief. Children suck sugar-cane until
they sicken, and may not grown man and woman weary of
sweet things, desiring to match their fortitude against grief?
And he is great of soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he would not look at her for anger, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Folly and double folly—woman’s madness! Have you
not heard the saying of the wise, that if ever he hears tell of
age and sickness and death, his doom is sealed? And mine
with it—and mine with it! For I love my son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the great tears overflowed her eyes and ran down like
a stream at the thaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgiveness!” she cried. “Forgiveness! for I love my husband,
and if this unknown sweetness capture and carry him
from me, what good should my life do me? But now, most
honoured father of my lord, I have a hope—a hope! Will a
child’s hand hold him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even as the words left her lips, he caught her two hands
and gazed deep into her eyes and triumphed. And he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daughter, you are hope, and your words a cup in the desert!
For, knowing what my son is to me, I know that those
hands will hold him when yours and mine drop helpless. Go
back to him and tell him, and to the great Gods do I give
thanks because my prayers and sacrifices have not run to waste
but are rewarded!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as she knelt before him, the tears rolled down his cheeks
for gladness, nor could he hide them, as a warrior should.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, beautiful as a rainbow flowering against a black cloud,
the Princess returned to the carved chamber of cedar with its
lattices set wide to the perfumed air of summer. Beneath and
around them the ivory chalices of the frangipani blossoms and
starred clouds of jasmine offered warm incense to the sun and
all was calm as ecstasy, as though the world, captured by the
power of Yoga, were in ecstasy, dreaming with open eyes upon
Perfection. The leaves of deep-foliaged trees floated on air in
absolute stillness, swimming, silent, in liquid gold, and below
the shades of the gardens gleamed Rohini, she also dancing no
longer as in spring, but calm and silent as the meditation of a
saint, pursuing her shining way in a deep quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, seated beneath a neem tree, in the green bower of
its heart, the Princess beheld Siddhartha as he sat with his feet
folded and his hands lying upon his knees. And as she
watched, kneeling by the lattice, he stirred no more than a
noble image of himself made in gold and there was that in his
calm that struck her soul with fear. Then presently, gathering
courage from knowledge of the gladness she bore within
her, she rose, and folding the gold sari about her brows, she
went with rose-leaf footsteps through the House of Joy, passing
those palace rooms where the fair women talked and
sang and made low music with their vinas and sitars, eating
fruits cooled in blocks of ice from the mountains and laughing
with each other as though joy could never cease nor death
wreck youth and life, for it seemed that the secret of the house
held them also and that they, like the Prince, believed that
these things were immortal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Yashodara, going through the garden ways, past groups
of tall flowers bee-haunted, flickered about by rose-coloured
and black butterflies, caught wafts of varying perfumes, like
strains of music through the opening and closing of celestial
doors, so sweet was the world that day. The jewelled peacock
and his wife led forth their train of little ones to pace in
deep grass and silver pheasants went daintily in the plumed
shades of the bamboo and their young followed rejoicing in
life and warmth and plenty, and birds hidden in high branches
sang as if never they would cease, and above all floated the
blue sky—a blue pure and strong as that of the infinite ocean,
and life and love wandered hand in hand along the blossomed
earth in sunlight like clear water. So though her secret winged
her feet the Princess must needs pause here and there to share
with all these living creatures the wine of joy poured from the
sun’s brimming cup, and her soul gladdened within her in the
youth of the world. And at last with steps light as the fall of
a petal she approached the great neem tree and stood and
looked into its shade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now here was an extraordinary stillness as though an arresting
finger were laid upon the pulse of life, but not wholly
silencing it, for from a fern-fringed spring there fell at regular
intervals a bright drop of water marking time into divisions
lest it should wholly slip into Eternity and be lost. And the
shade within was deep and green making a soft dusk at noon,
and through the shade could be seen the great spires of silver
mountains ecstatic in blue air and resembling the highest reach
of the aspiration of man arrested on the verge of comprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very still in green shade sat the son of the Maharaja, his
hands, palm upward, laid empty upon his knees, his eyes fixed
on the everlasting hills, neither joy nor trouble upon calm
brows, lost in meditation so deep that it walled him as in
crystal from the fair shows around, and her coming was nothing
to him for he neither saw nor heard it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a wave of anguish rose in her bosom and swelled until
it spilt in salt and bitter water from her eyes, and she could
not restrain herself from that forbidden show of sorrow and
putting aside the boughs she ran to him and fell at his knees
and laid her head upon them, sobbing. And with a long sigh
he awoke and looked down upon her, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, wife, and why do your eyes run like Rohini. Is
it a new gladness beyond gladness? And why are you so
glad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weeping and sobbing she hid her fair face upon his knees,
clasping them passionately, her words stumbling from her lips
in agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not gladness, O heart of my heart. It is grief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he, from the inward Kingdom of Calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is grief, my lotus flower?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For in all his life he had neither heard the word nor seen the
thing and she spoke an unknown language. And as she sobbed
on, he lifted her face gently in his two hands and looked at
her closed eyelids, the lashes wet and matted on her cheek
with running tears, she pale as death, the rich colour dead in
her lips, and on his beautiful face was amazement and no more,
for how could he pity who had lived only in the presence of
joy? And at last he said very slowly as if bewildered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My rose, my delight, what is this new thing, and what have
you to tell me? Speak that I may rejoice also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his words stung some terror in her because he could not
understand and it seemed that she must bear the burden of
grief and the hidden secret of the world’s woe not only for him
and herself, but for all the earth. For from any creature born
human, though young and beautiful and a Prince, it may well
seem a daring too great for mortals to deny grief and affront
sorrow and to shut the door in their grey faces—knowing them
waiting and watching outside. So the words broke from her
sobbing lips:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This morning I woke, and in the august quiet of the dawn
I knew that my hope of hopes was given to me and my joy
brimmed and sparkled in the cup of jewelled gold from the
Gods, and I would have turned then into my lord’s breast to
tell of it, but that night you had not passed with me but in
the chamber of deodar, so I lay and dreamed awake, lost in
bliss until they brought me word that our father would speak
with me, and I went.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But all this was good, my lily swaying on blue waters.
And what was your hope?” he said with a hand coming and
going softly in her hair, and the monotony and gentleness of
his touch soothed her like the immeasurable falling of far-distant
water—no louder than the humming of a bee. And
drawing more quiet breath, she continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our father asked me, lord of my soul, whether still you
escaped away in soul from all the love and laughter about you.
For when this is so, is it not that we fail to make you glad,
and am not I, your wife, the worst sinner? O heart of my
heart, what more is there that we have not done? Tell me,
I beseech you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he answered, “Nothing,” looking above her head to the
heights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passionately she caught his hands in hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, O beloved, if we have done all and fail, <span class='it'>what</span> is it
that draws you from me? What is your soul’s desire? When
our father, believing a man might weary of my poor beauty,
sought out new faces for the Painted Chambers, did I weep?
I smiled, though—But no, I will not say it. If it was your
pleasure, what should I be but glad? But still you were drawn
from us, and it has been a terror that bit into my soul, when
waking in a white moonlight, I have seen you sitting with alien
eyes fixed upon the great march of the stars. And yet I have
kept silence. But now, lord of my life I ask this—where is
it your soul goes, and to whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hands, hot with the fever of the soul, pleaded for her,
clasping his. Her dark eyes heavy with tears entreated mercy.
He answered gravely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I go to my own people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we are not your own people? Beloved, beloved—Your
words are swords, who then are your own?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hope forgotten, the Princess knelt beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O noble one, is it life or death that draws you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot tell. What is death? But life such as this is
weariness inexpressible, and how men endure it I cannot know.
Without change, break, or ripple the sunshiny days glide past,
each bringing in its hands the same offering of love and peace
monotonous as a dove’s cooing. My life is without hope, for,
having all, what is there to hope for? And what I have is over-sweet.
It cloys in the tasting like honey. And the Brahmans
make their sacrifices and mutter their mantras of invocation
and propitiation, and for what? For if we have all, what more
is there to have, and why pray for what is unneeded? If this
Paradise over-sweet can never crack asunder; if ages and ages
hence we still shall sit here young and beautiful as to-day,—the
Gods have emptied their hands and what have they left to
give? And if we do amiss, how shall they punish us? And
will not the day come when I may lift up my hand to the
mountains and curse them, saying—‘Be at ease in your careless
heavens, O unapproachable Gods,—but I am a man with
a soul not to be captured and tamed in earth’s paddock. I
demand my rights, though what they are I know not, for I
move in a perfumed cloud that blinds me. But I shall know
one day.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at him in fear that forbade speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear the noise of hammers outside the gardens, the cry
of the plougher, the song of the maids who come home with
cattle from the outer meadows. And I say that these people
have lives better than mine, and if I could change I would, for
sweet must be their sleep and glad their leisure, but for me life
is all idleness and sleep, and their eternity is better than my
own. I will ask my father to let me too go out and labour in
the glad world outside this prison, that buys its food with
happy toil, that I too may know what it is to eat the bread I
have earned in contentment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pale with fear Yashodara answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, lord of my life, how is it known to you that their life
is all good? Is it possible to envy what you know not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that with them life is eternal as with me and doubtless
joy perpetual. But to this they add useful toil that gives
us our luxuries. All these fair things about us are made by
the hands of free men rejoicing in beauty. And I make nothing.
I pass from one enjoyment to another, fettered—a
winged bird in a jewelled cage. Are they not happier than I?
And you, sweet wife,—what joy have you in comforting the
long hours of a slave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed his hands with passion, her black hair falling
silken about his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I that am the slave, my King—the happy slave of your
beauty and nobleness, and what could I ask but to wait eternally
upon your pleasure and that of your son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his eyes gravely upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son?” he said. And she:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true—it is true. And it is because I bear this hope
in my bosom that it pierces me like a sword to see your calm
averted eyes and know you far away in that strange heaven
where I cannot follow. O, my lord, if it be true that you have
alien kindred I cannot reach, let your son be of them. Give
him all good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then stooping, he drew her head to his breast and put his
arm about her and drew her gently until she sat upon his left
knee—that throne of the Indian wife, and thus they remained
awhile in silence, and his touch was better than speech and his
quiet healing as moonlight. Nor did she miss words of love or
rejoicing for his calm folded her in the very wings of peace.
At long last he spoke:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Pearl of Perfectness, we two are one, and of our true
oneness springs this new delight. To me the hope is sweeter
than all harps touched in the hollow of Heaven, and if you
were dear to me before, judge how dear now. But since we
are so one, come nearer, share my thought as well as my heart.
Does it content you that we should bring into our prison another
prisoner and one so dear? Here the days slip by uncounted—a
chain of fadeless flowers. Here the river links its
long silver thought for ever and ever down the channel from
the peaks. Here the bright birds flash by eternally. Will they
people the garden to overflowing with their beauty or do they
fly away to freer lands as I would if I could? When this garden
is full of our children and theirs, what then? Am I the
only prisoner or they also? <span class='it'>What</span> is the secret my father
holds from me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she, trembling, could answer nothing. And again there
was silence and only the bright slow dropping of the little
spring, and her heart forboded sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O day of joy made bitter with fear!” it said within her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again he fell into deep cold meditation, and forgot her
utterly and his arm relaxed and slipping fell beside him, and
she crept from his knee, and he did not know, staring with lost
eyes toward the stainless heavens. And for awhile she stood
and watched unnoticed, and then crept shuddering away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And beneath the shade of the neem Siddhartha sat motionless
until the rays from the low sun struck high up the tree
trunks, and sunset followed, a breath of rose on a rainbow sky,
and presently the moon rose unclouded in luminous loveliness
and floated to the zenith, and all boughs dropped dew, and
the mountains were lost in stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did any dare to break his dream.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time went by, each day sweet as new honey dripping
golden from a golden comb, sweet, inexpressibly
sweet, and the Princess, moving languidly, trembling with hope
mingled with doubt and fear, would tell only her joys to the
Maharaja Suddhodana and not her fears. For what help
was there in him? He could not strengthen the guarding gates
for they were strong and armed men watched by them, nor the
walls, for they were high, and observed from watch-towers.
And yet, day by day and night by night the spirit of Siddhartha
had passed invisible between the swords and unsleeping eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But since the hope of the Princess was made known to him,
he shut himself within the great gardens in spirit also. There
should no cloud dim the eyes of the mother of his son—flowers
must bud and blossom in her heart as about her slender feet,
and no thought but peace and security creep into her Paradise.
And little by little, as a wild deer glimpsing through the green
flies in terror, yet may be slowly won with patience and tenderness
till it will browse the rose-leaves in a girl’s hand, so
was the fear of the Princess put to sleep, and a low song of
joy and immeasurable thankfulness made music in her heart
like the summer voice of Rohini after the melting of the snows—when
the river is little and peaceful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And one day the Maharaja came to visit her in the cool
chamber of roses looking toward the north and the eternal
mountains and found her stringing jade and crystal and amber
on a fine golden cord, while ladies sat about her plucking rose
petals for paste of roses, and there was a sound of far music
in the gardens and looking through the lattice he saw Siddhartha
with his best and dearest cousin, the Prince Ananda, shooting
with bow and arrow in a wide meadow by the river, and
Devadatta and another of the Sakya lords stood by, and the
young men laughed and shouted, and their voices came small
and clear with distance, so that the heart of the King exulted
and he triumphed as he seated himself on the golden and peacock
cushions, dismissing the women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have conquered, lovely one!” he said, laughing kindly
in his black beard. “What neither I nor all my sages could
do your small wise hands have done, for in them the mother of
his child holds my son’s heart. I knew—I foretold, it must be
so, for he is loving and good and all the pieties of life hold
him like bands of iron. You are content?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noble father, I am content. I have no more ‘And yets’
with which to wound your ear. My lord leaves me neither by
night or day, except when I entreat him to try his strength with
Ananda and Devadatta and the Sakya lords. And this is
wisdom. We strained too tight upon the fetters and they ate
into his soul. This freedom among the young lords is well.
My noble father, I entreat you to give him what liberty
you can, for it is good. Never now do I see him submerged
in the cold dreams that stole him from us. Those strange
voices call him no more, the hands have ceased to beckon.
He is ours—yours and mine and the child’s, and of the child is
all his talk and thought. He shall ride with sword and lance
and be a King of Kings. So we say—one to the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up with tears of pure joy trembling like shed
diamonds on her long black lashes, and the Maharaja, grave
with delight, replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it shall be! What!—the kingdom of Maghada is ruled
by a foolish man—the King Bimbisara,—why shall not my son
oust him as we gather strength? Ha! are not we too of the
Arya—the great fighting people, and may not one elephant
subdue another! Daughter, I would have you breathe these
things in my son’s ear, and thrill him with hope of great splendours
for the child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She answered eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, I have done—I do it. I say each day—‘Give him
his inheritance, my lord. Let all good that you gain be his,
for he is yours and ours,’ and always he replies: ‘Could I
find the whole world’s Pearl it would be for my great father,
for you and for the child. Be content, wife, for my heart is
with my own people.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as she spoke his words the tears of gladness brimmed
and fell on the crystals and jade and amber in her golden lap
and the Raja clapped his hands together and shouted for joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, ha! we have won him! O auspicious daughter, dip your
hands in my treasury and take at your will. What reward is
enough for your beauty and wisdom? But now be cautious”—[There
he became grave and weighty]—“guard your health
and your person as the deposit of a King, and all shall be well.
And the day is not far distant when we shall laugh at the sickly
foretelling that said if he saw death, pain or old age he would
flee into the jungle. What! Shall not my son have strength
to face the common lot of man like a great King! But not
yet—not yet! We will go warily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the wise Princess saw that beneath his triumph he was
not even yet wholly reassured. But she herself was content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when Siddhartha returned flushed and gay from riding
and shooting by the parks of Rohini with the great bow in
his hand and quiver at his shoulder, a glittering glorious young
warrior, she clung about him shining with bliss so that it appeared
that visible rays surrounded her as they do the Dawn
Maiden when she, standing, flings her golden arrows about the
world from the peaks of Himalaya. And with his arms about
her in their chamber of marble he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is my dove content? And is life good?” and she replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most utterly content. If life is good to my lord it is delight
to me. But you, O, heart’s dearest—and are you not
content? See how the world is white with blossom dropping
perfumed dew, and the blue birds flash through them, and there
is piping and singing and the flutter of wings through all the
happy gardens and the humming of black bees mad for honey.
And this morning as I walked with Gautami the slender-waisted,
close, close hidden in the jasmin flowers I found a
small nest—small and heart-holding and in it four blue jewels
of eggs warm from the mother’s breast—warm as love and
home, and blue as the skies, and I looked and said—‘One, two,
three, four. This is a prophecy. These are the three sons
and the one daughter I shall bear to my lord. First—three
sons, one by one, and then a daughter so lovely that all Kings
of the earth shall desire her, and the three strong brothers shall
guard her beauty—that is fit only for the enjoyment of the
King of the Three Worlds! And we will hide this lovely one
in the heart of the gardens until he comes. Now, since I have
seen this portent, four there must be. Less there cannot.
But possibly more!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she leaned back, flashing the sunshine of her eyes in
his, and he laughed back holding her by the two hands, half
dazzled with her beauty and gladness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is life,” he said—“and the cold dreams are gone.
They rose like mists from Rohini in autumn mornings—and in
the rising of the sun they disperse. And the coming of my son
has driven them into the night where they belong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore great gladness reigned in the House of Gardens
and doubt was forgotten, and in his pride, willing to make his
son more free and yet security more secure, the Maharaja
made another and most beautiful garden across the city where
Siddhartha might take his pleasure if he wearied of the Gardens
of Rohini, and the Princess approved this with her wisdom,
saying: “We must stretch the tether, lest the bird guess
he is not free to fly into the distances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was a most exquisite garden, with great pools and
lakes where white cranes stood meditating all day among blue
lotus blossoms—the very essence of the blue of the waters, and
it was made a Paradise where none might take life or harm the
creatures of earth or air or water, and the wild swans floated
as pure and fearless upon those lakes as upon the bosom of
holy Manasa in the sky-uplifted bosom of the mountains, and
the deer were not shy but walked beside men, and with great
eyes, silent though full of speech, told them the hidden histories
of their wild hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And on a certain day Siddhartha sent a message to his
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great father, if my Paradise is ready, give me permission
to drive through the city to-morrow that I may enjoy it with
my cousins Ananda and Devadatta and the Sakya lords.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the answer returned was “To-morrow,” and that night
Siddhartha passed with his wife Yashodara in a pavilion of
Chinese silks with blue and gold dragons by the banks where
Rohini wandered among her reeds singing a little song of sleep,
and as the orange sunset faded into grey a few large stars came
out, and swam in immeasurable deeps above them. And she
said, holding his hand:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How beautiful—how beautiful is the coming of the night
with all the stars caught like bees in her net of blue,—and is
it not strange, O lord of my life, to think that long ages after
we and our love are forgotten other lovers shall sit by this little
river and see the night glide down the mountains scattering
stars about the world like seeds of light. Shall we see, shall
we know, in those cold other lives they promise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he in great astonishment:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgotten? In what age to come shall you not still be
loveliest and gentlest, Queen of the whole earth for beauty?
Then, as now, shall men come to happy Kapila because the city
holds the most beautiful as the shell its pearl. How should we
be forgotten?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And for a moment cold fear crept by her like the silent passing
of a snake, compelling her to remember that the truth was
shut from those dear eyes, light of her life,—and she brushed it
from her and said laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True—who should forget us? I dream sometimes that of
all names in the world my lord’s shall be greatest, uplifted,
splendid, like that great star throbbing upon the topmost peak
of all, and men shall bow down and do homage to it not only
in the land of the Sakyas and in Maghada and Kosala, but in
the wide great world among strange people who send us their
treasures but whose very names we cannot utter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you have dreamed this, beloved? And how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have dreams that beat in my ears and their sound goes
over the mountains, north and south and east and west. And
the sun is dimmed with fumes of incense offered to a great
King. And I see golden palaces like the sands of all the rivers
for number, with my lord sitting throned beneath them in gold—palaces
innumerable, and flowers cast in heaps to exhale
their perfume. And all this in my lord’s honour. This have
I dreamed four times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he said, slowly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my dream also. Certainly the Gods come in dream.
But who can say? See, beloved, how the night, mother of
men, brings us her dark reposes lulling all things to sleep.
There is no moon, but strange spirits as white as moonbeams
moving among the trees. Sing low to me, beloved, sing low.
I would not see their eyes—they look upon me with thoughts
I cannot read. Sing to me—fill my eyes with the love in yours.
Sing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she took her sitar of ebony and ivory and sang softly
as Rohini that made a silver music at their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was a seal upon her lips that she might not sing
of love though love was beside her, for the awe of the mountains
was heavy on them and the listening of night. Therefore
she sang these words, but no louder than a bee hovering
about a flower.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The wild swans rise from earth,</p>
<p class='line0'>Strong in the path of the sun.</p>
<p class='line0'>How should it give them mirth</p>
<p class='line0'>With his great day begun?</p>
<p class='line0'>Upward the white wings fly,</p>
<p class='line0'>Clouds in the bluest blue,</p>
<p class='line0'>Far they soar—and high!—</p>
<p class='line0'>Would I might follow too.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And again after awhile she sang a great hymn of the ancient
Scripture but lower still:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Though difference be none, I am of Thee,</p>
<p class='line0'>Not Thou, O Lord, of me.</p>
<p class='line0'>For of the sea is verily the wave,</p>
<p class='line0'>Not of the wave the sea.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And there was silence, and he turned and laid his cheek to
hers and they sat together long, gazing speechless at the marvel
of the starry deeps. Nor did they know that their last
night of peace was with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the commands of the Maharaja went out into
every street and house of Kapila.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow the chariot of my son goes through the streets
to the Paradise of Pleasure. See and beware that no aged man
or woman be abroad in the city, for my son’s eyes must behold
no aged, sick or dead person. It is forbidden by the Powers
that rule his destiny. Therefore let none but healthy, glad
and beautiful persons fall in his way, for if otherwise the transgressor
must die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was not a soul in the place but heard this command
and touching their foreheads murmured, “It is an order.”
And men, women and children ran busily here and
there garlanding the happy streets, and they set up poles
gilded and painted and with gay fluttering banners. And
dwarfed trees after the Chinese manner were placed along the
roads, and there were hanging canopies of blue and rose silk,
and magnificent tapestries were hung from the windows, until
the city shone beautiful as the Paradise of the Gods on the holy
mountain Sumeru, and bands of children running like the lesser
angels strewed flowers through all the ways where Siddhartha
should pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then steadily as the running of a river the people poured in
from the country-side to see their young Prince, and the ways
were gay with happy folk dressed in their best and garlanded
with garlands of marigolds and little rosebuds scented with fragrant
oils to increase their own fragrance. The towers were
filled with men and women clustering like bees. The mounds
by the trees, the windows and terraces—were thronged with
eager persons,—the men looking sharply about them to see that
nothing was left which might offend the eyes of the heir. And
there was nothing, for in bright sunshine, tempered by a cool
breath from the mountains none but happy and beautiful people
with their children rejoiced and were glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now see the glorious chariot of ivory inlaid with gold made
ready by the gate of the Garden House, fronted with jewels
glittering in the bright challenging sunbeams, spread with noble
silks flowered with gold, and drawn by four equal-pacing
stately horses, white as the ivory they drew, and harnessed
with splendour,—their pride subdued to the pride of their master.
And beside them stood Channa, the charioteer, a young
man well born and noble in mind and person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So having saluted his wife, the Princess Yashodara, the
Prince Siddhartha advancing ascended the chariot, robed in
gold and jewels and appearing like Surya the sun when he
blazes at his zenith, and all veiled their eyes from his brilliance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he came through the streets, his horses pacing gently,
the people swayed toward him and a whisper of awe and delight
ran through them like the breathing of a breeze that
blows the blossoms in passing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking upon them his heart exulted with joy and kindness,
for he thought—“This is my city of delight. These are my
people, and it shall eternally be my bliss to do them good.
Look at the strong fathers holding up their little sweet children
to see their Prince. Their hearts are full of love even as
my own. Look at the lovely mothers with their babes in
warm bosoms—only less fair than Yashodara, and full of love
and gentleness. And the glorious young men straight and tall,
and the antelope-eyed girls with silken hair braided with blossoms.
The Gods know it is a happy world with all these noble
creatures in it, and my sick dreams of I know not what are
dispersed in this bliss and the great joy of my people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he saluted with his hands, smiling right and left that
none might be forgotten, and sometimes from the chariot he
took an armful of flowers and tossed them lightly among the
crowd and they were gathered up with delight and pressed
to eager lips and brows because they had touched the Prince’s
hand. So he went through the city, marvelling why his father
had forbidden it hitherto. And as he flung his last handful
of flowers the appointed moment struck—predestined by the
Rulers,—and across the way of the chariot staggered an old,
old man, and the stately stallions arched white necks and tossed
their heads in disdain at this revolting sight, for they too had
beheld nothing but loveliness until that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And because the commands of the Maharaja were stern it
is said that this figure was no mortal man but a divinity hidden
in flesh whom none could let or hinder and that the myriad
people of Kapila saw nothing of this—but two saw clearly—the
Prince and the charioteer, Channa. And how this may
be I cannot tell. Thus have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the aged man with tattered white hair depending from
his bleached and bony head like lichen from a stricken tree,
supporting his painful steps on a stick, weak, imbecile, skinny
jaw fallen disclosing toothless gums, eyes red and bleared, without
lashes, and moisture oozing from them, drawing oppressed
and painful breath and terror-stricken amidst the crowds,
tottered across the flowery way and sank, heaped and huddled
beside the chariot, casting a look of terror upon the radiant
Prince, and mumbling and muttering what none could hear,
his head shaking like a leaf in wind. And it was as if darkness
and terror obliterated the sun and all the crowded people
bowed forward to see the stopping of the chariot, breathlessly
remembering the Maharaja’s commands, but none stirred in
his place and even the children were dumb. And yet they
had seen nothing but the face of the Prince with a shadow
fallen upon it. And the Prince laid his hand on the reins and
the horses stopped with drooped crests, and shaken with horror
he cried aloud to the charioteer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Channa, what is it? What is this man? If indeed man
it be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the old man crouched there, muttering, and great fear
held Channa silent, and again the Prince cried aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again the crowd sighed like the first stirring of winter
answer from Channa’s lips where he stood, bowed over the
golden reins grasped in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prince, this is an old man. This is old age.” And a long
sighing sob commoved the crowded people as though their
doom were pronounced, when they heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Prince, the words almost dying on his lips, said
trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is old age? Was this unhappy one born so, or has
it fallen as a judgment from Heaven?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again the crowd sighed like the first stirring of winter
winds and Channa, face hidden, replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prince, he was not so born, nor is it the Gods’ anger, but
this is the common lot and to every man born on earth it comes
nor can it be escaped. This ruin of a man was once a child at
his mother’s breast, and then a boy filled with laughter and
sportive gaiety, a joy to see and hear. Later, a youth, beautiful,
amorous and brave, such as attended on bliss, and in
enjoyment of the Five Pleasures. But old age, dogging the
steps of men as a hound with fell teeth, has dragged him down
at last and had its will of him, and he lives a life of pain
and men avoid him and women pass him by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And some women in the crowd wept aloud, and the air was
heavy with sighing and the old man moaned and muttered
with toothless jaws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Prince, still unbelieving and trembling said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will this doom come upon my great father?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noble sir, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And upon the beauty of—my ladies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And upon me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was a fearful silence like death among the crowd
and no word from Channa so that had a breath stirred in the
palms it would have affrighted the soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly the Prince cried aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn back the chariot. What heart have I for pleasures!
Tear down the garlands. Where is there room for joy! I
have seen what I have seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, wordless, Channa turned the white horses, and guided
the chariot along the way it came and the people fell back to
make way, and men and women hid their faces like mourners
for it seemed as though in the knowledge of the Prince knowledge
had come to them also of the terror of life and the doom
inevitable.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>N</span><span class='sc'>ow</span> when Siddhartha returned to the Garden House,
one ran before him and told the women what had
occurred and the ladies bore the news to the Princess
where she waited, and when she heard it she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O ill-foreboding heart of mine! Did I not know that the
anger of the Gods must burn against those who would conceal
their righteous doom from any man born upon this cruel
earth? For who can fight with fate? If this drives my lord
to despair, what shall be done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she sent messages to the Maharaja telling him the danger
and went forth into the Painted Hall to seek the Prince, and
he sat there alone, surrounded by lovely images painted upon
the walls, where joy and triumph and love clasped hands,
and dancing limbs shone amongst flowers and all the world
was white with spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now something in his eyes held his wife from him and she
had no courage to draw near, and went and sat herself humbly
on the ground before him but at a distance, and at last he
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was the secret. You knew it and did not tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in the hall was no sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw me fed with lies such as these—” (and he flung
out his arm against the pictures) “and you did not tell me
they were the mask of horror.” She bowed her head upon her
hands speechless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I, most pitiable, most ignorant, rejoiced that a son
should be given to me, not knowing that such a one is born to
a heritage of wretchedness and the inevitable approach of
shame and ruin. And from this is no escape, for the Gods
have appointed no end to our misery, no door from the prison,
but we must live eternally and horribly, old and disgraced in
body and mind. Could a man but end it and fall into the
dark and be forgotten! O had I known, no child of mine
should ever have felt the whip and dragged the chain. I will
not blame you who are but a woman,—but my father—my
father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in the hall was no sound at all. And the Princess, hiding
her face, thought, “Shall I tell him of the end—of Death?”
But she dared not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he called aloud for the women and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deface these pictures for they are lies, and the sight of
them turns the knife in the wound. Blot them out with
blackness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was done, but the Maharaja in terror bade them redouble
the pleasures of the Paradise and of the Garden House.
And at great cost he bought a fair slave from the outlands,
golden-haired as dawn, sapphire-eyed as blue ice of the
Himalaya, white as the elephants’ tusk, skilled in all arts of
love, and among the darker beauties of the pleasure chambers
she moved radiant as though day had broken forth in starry
midnight, and all the neighbouring Kings hearing were envious.
And in this beauty all hoped, even the sad Yashodara, and her
heart failed her when she saw the Prince’s eyes coldly averted
from loveliness that might have stirred the eternal Gods.
And again she sent a message to the Maharaja.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your son, my lord, will not look upon the beautiful white
stranger nor on any. O send him forth in freedom, for penned
in these sweet gardens he muses and meditates and what is in
his heart I cannot know, but fear very terribly. Yet guard
the way that no sad sight approach him, for if he sees more
all is lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again orders were given, and as before the Prince set
forth, but this time grave and sad, and the crowds shared
his mood and the city could not rejoice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as they neared the street all a-flutter with banners and
flowers and perfumes and thronged with silent gazing thousands
again a divinity masked his divinity in tortured flesh
(thus it is told), and by the way was seen a sick man struggling
for life in a losing battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His body was swollen and disfigured, his hollow cheeks
blazed with fever and in his dying eyes fear and agony contended.
Scarce could he drag himself along, moaning and crying
for pity, the hot tears pouring and searing his cheeks as
they ran. And seeing it, the Prince set his hands on the
reins and checked the horses and cried aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this horror?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the charioteer, Channa, with fear tearing at his vitals,
yet compelled by a force beyond all resistance to no other than
the truth, answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prince, it is a sick man. The four elements are all confused
and disordered, he is worn, feeble, and strengthless, tortured
in body and mind, dependent upon the mercy of men
whose own evil day is but postponed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a shudder ran through the crowd as the Prince questioned
him, shrinking back as one in mortal fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this too is the common doom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prince, none escape it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the few poor years that old age leaves us are broken
into misery like this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prince, so it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn my chariot again, I will go no further. I have seen
what I have seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the news was carried to the Maharaja and he was almost
beside himself, raging with anger that was half fear, and he
sent for his wise minister, and cried to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall we do? For my son is learning the guarded
secrets, and if I keep him shut in the gardens he will rebel
and break away, and if I send him through the city such
devils are my servants that horrible sights afflict him and disperse
my hopes in him. Here have I built a Paradise so
heavenly that could he but see it I need fear no more, for the
man is not born who could leave its deep and delicious shades
for the dusty world. And there have I placed a golden maiden
whose smile is sunshine and her lips singing roses, and were
he to see her—But what do I say? Is it not possible to
a great person like myself that for a few short hours the
city ways should be guarded from horror while he passes
through? I am fallen indeed, otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the old wise minister shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Sir, one should say it is possible, yet when I remember
how the city was searched and guarded this twice, what
dare I say? O Maharaj—may it not be that the high Gods
being resolved may not be thwarted, and that we fight against
iron destiny? Great fear possesses me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his Master replied angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foolish old man! And was I not given the choice? If
I could withhold the truth he would be a great world-King. If
he guessed it he would be an ascetic of the jungles. What
father would choose other than I have done? Once more I
will send him to my Paradise, and if this time I am tricked
let your head answer it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again the Prince was sent out but this time also though
the city was decorated and garlanded, there was no semblance
of joy, and the very horses went with drooped heads as
though fear were the charioteer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as they reached the street, where most the people
crowded, the Divinity was again ready with his work, having
prepared a sight terrible and woeful. For slowly preceding
the chariot there went a funeral train, with four men bearing
a bier and lying on it a body cold and stiff, with dropped jaw
and dreadful dead eyes staring blindly at the sun. Withered
flowers lay on the bier and the mourners beat their breasts
and wept aloud, filling the air with wailing and lamentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Prince closing his eyes to shut out the horror, and
clenching his palms said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Channa not daring to look in his face, answered very
low: bowed under the weight of words he was compelled to
utter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a dead man, all his powers of body destroyed, life
departed, his heart without thought, his intellect dispersed.
His spirit is fled, his body withered, stretched out like a dead
log, taken from all who loved him. And mourning they carry
him forth to burn and obliterate him, for they—even they—will
have no more of his presence now become loathsome, but
cast him from them utterly. And this is Death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And into his clenched hands he murmured:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this also the common lot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the charioteer replied, with hidden face:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prince, so it is. He who begins his life must end it. And
thus. For death may at any moment seize us and carry us
away into darkness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Siddhartha sank down in the chariot, his soul warring
with his body, catching at the leaning-board for support, hiding
his face from the light of day as the dead man was borne
on before him and wailing and lamentation filled the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And into his clenched hands he murmured:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O terrible delusion of mortal men, who born in pain and
utterly deluded are brought through grief and sickness and old
age to this frightful end! Disperse the people. Turn back
my chariot. The whole world is a lie. I have seen what
I have seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the people melted silently away in tears, as clouds disperse
in rain. For seeing the Prince’s horror and amazement
in learning the truth, for the first time they also sounded the
deeps of their own misery, and life appeared to them a traitor,
and in all the universe was no comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Channa the charioteer, not daring to return because of
the Maharaja’s strict command, drove onward to the Paradise,
and the Prince crouching in the silks and gold with face hidden
neither knew nor cared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So at last they came in among the green lawns and pleasant
waters and deep-leaved trees, the last hope of the Maharaja,
and slowly and painfully he dismounted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly about the chariot, running and fluttering like
doves came the lovely ones provided for pleasure, beautiful
as flowers in a Paradise of Gods, adorned with chains of pearls
and other jewels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beautiful were they, each one chosen as merchants choose
a pearl to complete a queen’s necklace, for their eyes were
long and languishing, half hidden in black lashes as stars in
midnight, and their mouths pomegranate buds disclosing seeds
of ivory, and down to the ankle rolled their lengths of perfumed
hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most beautiful is the bosom of a woman, for in its gentle
curves are all love, all tenderness expressed, and these displayed
its loveliness—dear as rare jasmin flowers, precious as sweet
food to the hungry, unveiled or veiled a little in transparency
like the running of shallow water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus they surrounded him as he passed through the
blossomed trees rapt in sorrowful meditation, pale with the
terror of gazing for the first time on the face of Death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they fluttered about him, the lovely ones, skilled in all
subtleties of love, shedding enticements as the moon distils
dews of camphor. One, seeing him sad, saddened her sweet
face and looked at him with tears hanging on long lashes, as
though she would say—“Dear Prince, I too have tasted grief.
Do I not know?” And one, smiles chasing one another to
cover in her merry eyes, promised forgetfulness, gladness in
her arms, and some clinging together like sister roses on
twined stems, seemed to defy severance even if love should call
them, tempting him who watched them to essay that sweet
sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But amidst them the Prince paced lost in grief, not seeing
them, or, seeing, heeding not at all. And presently when they
had tried all their arts and could draw his regards no more
than remote stars can draw the gaze of a cold moon, they fell
silent and gathered fearfully into groups,—drawing back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now there stood in the shade of the bamboos a man much
about the person of the Maharaja, sent to see if all were well,
and when the Prince passed on, careless, this nobleman, Udayi,
came out and addressed the silent beauties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You women, all so graceful and fair, are you thus worsted?
Surely in all ages men have been subject to women when they
put forth their power. Too soon are you discouraged—too
soon. For this Prince, though he restrains his heart with the
bit and bridle of purity, is but a man, and the wisest and
greatest in time past have slipped where they thought themselves
secure. And there is no fetter strong as white arms
about a man’s neck. Strive after new devices. Redouble
your efforts. Great is the prize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the maidens, ashamed and angry at his chiding, fluttered
again about the Prince where he sat in the shade of a jambu
tree, putting forth amorous enticements, forgetful of all
modesty and womanly reserve, pressing on, striving to move
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he in his great heart, sorrowful, apart, looked upon them,
sighing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O creatures most miserable, unheeding the dooms of age
and death, forgetful of the briefness of beauty, unconscious
that above your throats is suspended the sharp two-edged
sword, how wretched is your empty playing in the very jaws
of destruction!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And though he spoke nothing, they saw the homeless horror
in his eyes, and again they shrank away afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So seeing the Prince alone, Udayi, smooth of speech, came
softly along the pleasure-paths of the Paradise, brushing aside
the flowers, observant and quiet as a serpent, and saluting the
Prince he drew up beside him and spoke this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prince in whom all beauty and nobility meet, you sit
here sad and alone, and it is therefore that your great father,
consumed by care for your welfare appointed me to act as
beseems a friend. Permit me then to speak, for a wise friend
removes what is unprofitable, promotes real gain, and in
adversity is true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Siddhartha lifting his eyes said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak, if indeed in this great strait there be anything to
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So supporting his arm on a bough of the fire-flame tree
Udayi spoke, inclining his delicate dark face and subtle eyes
toward the Prince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True it is that sickness may assail us and that old age
and death will by no means be baulked of their prey, yet youth
is youth and beauty divine, and the man who turns his back
on pleasure because it passes is a coward. Indeed the rose
is the sweeter because even in blooming it treads the way of
death and soon we see it no more. Truly, my Prince, you
are afflicted with a distempered mind. Acquiescence is the
secret of life. We who are wise know that these things must
be, and even old age and death, the conquerors, we take to
enhance our pleasures, saying to ourselves, ‘The moment is
mine, and love is sweet and lust the spur of life. This moment
neither death nor old age can take from me. I will spend it
as a man would spend his all if he knew that next day he would
be plundered, and a beggar.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Siddhartha was silent, with brooding eyes fixed on the
ground, and presently Udayi resumed, in a delicately modulated
voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While you believed that joy and beauty were eternal, and
that ages hence these women would still surround you, beautiful
and yielding, then you might well shrink from a delight
too prolonged, for dropped honey cloys. An eternity of love
may well become hell. Was it not so, my Prince.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And slowly the Prince answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was so. I have looked on the racing river, swollen with
melting snows, thinking that, were any end possible, to be
hurled beaten and broken down the rocks in its mad hurry
were better than the changeless Paradise of love and soft words
and swooning music. There you are right, Udayi the smooth-tongued.
This is true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And highly satisfied, Udayi resumed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, having learnt that there <span class='it'>is</span> an end, what should
be your course? The pleasures of a prisoner released, who
enjoys knowing that he has a respite though the doors will
shut upon him one day. Surely it is not the part of a brave
man to fling away what he has because he cannot have all,
nor to own himself conquered because one day he must face
the enemy whom as yet he has not seen. No—not so. Take
what the Gods send—the Gods who have themselves been
amenable to beauty and docile in the arms of loveliness.
Indeed what choice is there but to slink through life starting
at every shadow, or to dice and drink and love, like a man
tasting the best while it lasts. For what comes after we cannot
tell. Who knows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Prince said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This has the sound of wisdom, yet wisdom it is not. There
is an answer—there is a way, but I have not found it. It may
be that it cannot be found—that there is no such thing. Yet,
better the search than dully to agree with necessity. And as
for these women—To me they are no enticement, and if I
would I cannot. Under their fair faces I see the skull and
they mop and mow like apes in the face of Horror. If the
Gods have thus made the world it is a folly and a brutality
and they are more foolish than men who must abide their
cruelties, and if they have not made it and all is chance we
sink in the slough lit only by the flicker of dying dreams.
Leave me, Udayi the smooth-tongued. I would be alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the courtier crept silently away under green shades,
treading lightly on turf and blossoms, thanking destiny that he
was not as Siddhartha but could lift the brimming cup and
drain it to the dregs, savouring every sparkle. And in his
heart he mocked him, laughing at his weakness—he whose
name is now remembered only because one day he spread out
his folly before the Perfect One!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Prince, bending his great brows upon life and
death, sat beneath the jambu tree, feet folded, hands laid
upon his knees in perfect immobility. And he thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hollow compliance and a protesting heart! Is this life?
Is there a better? Great are the concerns of life and death.
So great, so awful that the poor race of mankind struggles
only to forget for a brief moment what it can never comprehend.
For all about us are seen injustices that were a King
to commit his miserable people would rise and hurl him from
his bloody throne. And we are told of the priests that the
Gods have committed these crimes and yet are worthy of
worship and honour. No—rather is it the propitiation of
fiends who will torture us if they have not the servility of our
praises while we die for their pleasure. And the good suffer
and the evil flourish, and to the rich man is given more riches
and to the poor more toil even exceeding their strength. Now
indeed all that was hidden from me bursts upon my mind as
when a flash of lightning tears the dark, and things I put aside
for want of comprehension shriek aloud in my ears. Why
am I clothed in jewels, why is my father generous and good,
and my wife the fairest and most loving of women, when at this
moment were my eyes opened they would behold men dying
for bread that the least of my jewels would buy, with none to
tend or pity them. And what are my deserts more than
theirs? And why are some evil and some good as it were by
nature? O cruel Gods who, lapt in far-off pleasures, care
nothing for our agonies, and let fall your good things on the
wicked and evil things on the good—yourselves perhaps the
sport of chance, if indeed you are at all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And these thoughts and many like them, black and miserable,
stormed about him in the wreckage of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at long last he aroused himself and the Paradise was
empty of all but a broad moonlight that lay in glories of light
and shadow on trees and waters and there was deep silence.
For the women, ashamed and terrified, had slipt noiselessly
away and so back to the city, and far off down a long glade his
chariot and wearied horses stood waiting in marble patience,
and Channa sat beside them his head bowed upon his raised
knees like an embodied grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very slowly the horses paced through the city, and that
also was empty of all but moonlight, for not a living soul
went or came in the quiet, and the pacing of the horses echoed
loudly down the empty ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And not a word was spoken as they went, but when they
reached the House of the Garden, a woman ran out to meet
them veiled like a ghost in the moonlight, and cried aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O happy Prince, and happiest,—the Gods are good to this
glad House and to you, for on the bosom of the Princess lies
your first-born son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at these words a strange trembling seized him, so that
for a moment he hid his face in his hands. Then pale in the
moonlight he said these words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fetter, a fetter is set upon me, therefore call the child
Rahula, a Fetter.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>N</span><span class='sc'>ow</span> at the birth of her son, so great was the joy
of the Princess that life and death were little things
in her eyes, black rocks submerged in bright water
glittering with sunshine, and every day she blossomed more
beautiful and the child in her arms was like the star shining
within the moon’s crescent. And seeing this what could the
nobility of Siddhartha do otherwise than hide his grief and
deep searchings of a heart tossed like waves in a mighty wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beautiful in his eyes was the tenderness of the lovely mother
and her eyes dwelling upon him and the child, but terrible
also remembering that at any moment the bright picture of
life might break asunder and disclose beneath the lurking
horror of death and the dark and unknown hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For if the Gods with their utmost forethought had made the
world so full of shameful things, what wise man could trust
such unskilful workmen for the world to come, and no hope
was left anywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat much alone by Rohini, his gaze dwelling on the silver
peaks far off and serene in blue air, and at his feet little fish
darted in the transparency of the pure waters, and the pheasant
would lead her brood to his unmoving feet, and the shimmering
peacocks feed beside him. And when the wild white swans
spread snowy vans above his head, taking wing for the mountains
and for far lands beyond that he knew not, it seemed
in his deep musings that all these happy creatures were subject
to a law they knew and obeyed with content and that their
life was better than his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But compassion grew daily in his heart now that his eyes
were opened—Compassion for all the sorrows that surrounded
him bleeding in his heart like a wound such as drains life
itself away. He saw the little lovely dancer Amra drag wearied
feet through the dance one night and called her to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child, what ails you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great my lord, I must not tell you. But I dance no more.
To-morrow I go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child, I command you to speak. What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked about her with eyes large and fearful as the deer’s
when she sees the hunter’s knife glitter above her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great my lord, it is an order. I dare not speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My order stands higher. Speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She trembled as she stood, with fear and weakness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord, it is the sickness. Two years ago my sister
Vijaya was a dancer. Yourself has commended her. But
the cruel cough came and tore her breast, and at last she could
scarcely lift her little feet, and then they sent her secretly
away, and she spat blood and the cough devoured her, and
she died. And now it has taken me also and the blood came
from my mouth last night, and to-morrow I go. But O I beseech
your greatness to hide my words, for it is forbidden that
any grief should soil the air about your noble presence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when you rest the cough will decline and you will be
glad again, my sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Prince, I shall die. For this there is no cure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you fear this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord, I fear very terribly—but there is no help. What
must be, must. And I am now too weary to dance, and it is
better I die for I am a burden and a distress to my mother now
I am worth no more money, and she is poor. There is scarce
bread to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the blood poured into the pale face of Siddhartha for
shame and horror, and he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On such foundations was my happiness built, and others
have bled and wept that I might laugh! O, evil Gods, shameful
and disastrous to man, if this is all! How shall the heart
of man forgive your crimes against us, and where is justice
in all the wide Three Worlds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he spoke he lifted the chain of pearls from his shoulders
and threw them upon the dancer’s and she, beholding his
nobleness and grief with tears, went sobbing away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day he sent a message to the Maharaja.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great father, since now I know all the secrets and there
is nothing hidden from me of the world’s woe, what hinders
that I should go free to see it? It may be that some joy shall
meet my eyes and relieve the burning of the flame of pity
that consumes me. Also, since I have a son it is now surely
well that I should see and know the lives of the people whom
he and I one day shall rule. And I say this for truth, I am
weary, weary even to death of the music and dancing and the
miserable diversions of my prison, and if there be any hope
for me it is in the things of men, for I have done with those
of women and children. Set your prisoner free. It is your
son who beseeches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the Maharaja agreed, the Prince sent another
message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And let the city be neither decorated nor feasting. I desire
to see the life of the people as they live it, not as they would
pretend it is lived to please us great ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this too was conceded, but the Maharaja commanded
that the chief minister and a guard of the Sakya lords should
accompany the Prince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore once more the chariot and well-paced horses were
prepared, adorned with precious stones and gold glittering like
splendid sunshine, and he passed through the city and out by
the further gate into a new world hitherto unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he went on the road was smooth and white, and
gardens gay on either side and trees loaded, some with flowers
and some with fruit, and seeing this and knowing it unprepared
for his eyes, his heart stirred under the snow of grief
and thawed a little from its ice, for it seemed that the people
who lived therein must know some happiness and freedom
from misery. But as he went further the heat of the day
strengthened and became like a weight of lead, oppressive
even beneath the silken canopy of the chariot and the sweat
stood on his brow and his garments clung to the moisture
of his skin and weariness weighed upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for all this the toil about him could not cease, for men
must eat, and work be completed and the fields of the
Maharaja ploughed, and he saw how the labourers struggled
with painful exertion, their bodies bent, their wet hair falling
about haggard faces, their bodies fouled with mud and dust.
And some were old and some were weak, and yet all must
greatly toil and very pitiful was it to see their strained muscles
and starting eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ploughing oxen also—they, toiling so pitifully and with
no reward,—their lolling tongues and gaping jaws, the whip
and goad indenting smooth flanks until bright blood drops
started and they trembled and shrank—all these things tortured
the mind of Siddhartha as he sat silently observant.
And he said within himself:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The world is built on pain and its foundations laid in agony.
O Gods, most cruel and unjust, if there be a way, where is it?
If there be a Law of Peace, where shall I find it? For I am
bound in the dungeons of despair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, nobly moved to sympathy, he dismounted from the
chariot, forcing himself to look steadfastly upon the sufferings
of man and beast, and he sat down beneath a jambu tree,
reflecting on the ways of death and birth. And he desired
his companions, the Sakya lords, to leave him and wander
where they would, and they went away laughing with each
other and talking, costly umbrellas borne over them in the
heat until they should reach the shade of the forest and there
rest beside their wines and fruits. And then, as was now his
wont, he gave himself to deep meditation on life and death, on
transiency, and the progress of all to decay, desiring with all
his soul that somewhere, anywhere, he might behold the
changeless, the Abiding and in that find rest. And he asked of
his soul:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there safety in riches? Are the rich exempt and high
in the Gods’ favour. No—no, indeed,—for their very luxuries
consume them body and soul, making their bodies the
home of disease and death, and their souls the harbourage of
cowardice and terror. For it is harder to leave a Palace of
gold than a mud hovel, and these are the spoilt children of the
universe. There is no refuge in riches. In all the Three
Worlds I see no refuge at all from the three Enemies—death,
old age, and disease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he meditated, his heart thus fixed, the five senses,
as it were, extinguished, lost in the clear light of insight he
entered on the first stage of pure rapture. All low desires
submerged and in an ecstasy that was not joy but perfect
clarity he saw the misery and sorrow of the world, sounding
its deeps of agony and loss, the ruin wrought by age, disease,
and death,—the hopeless dark beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto he had known only in part, but now the whole, even
as an eagle suspended on unmoving pinions, floating in supernal
sunshine looks down beholding the earth spread like a
picture below him, and nothing hidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly a great light shone within him—not to be
described in words nor in thought comprehended. And he
said these words, radiant with the first dawning beams of
illumination:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard the wisdom of men and it is the crackling
of dry wood in a destroying fire. Now will I seek a Noble
Law they have not known, a Law hidden and divine, and I will
wrestle with disease and age and death and bind their terrors.
For behind these things is Peace, if the way is opened. And
I will seek until I die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And slowly at length, passing downward from ecstasy his
thoughts collecting centred again about things earthly, and
he became aware that a man approached him, carrying a bowl
in his hand, wearing a coarse robe of yellow, pacing slowly
in the roadway. And their eyes met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it appeared to the Prince that he had never before seen
a man who resembled this strange mendicant, and he rose to
greet him with courtesy, saying in his heart:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is this person? For his face is calm and joyful, and
his eyes bespeak a soul at rest. Nor has he the mien of one
tricked by sensual happiness, but austerity and contentment
guide him, and though he treads on earth it does not hold
him. And what is this bowl in his hand? I will accost him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this done, the stranger, with due salutation grave and
sweet, replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great lord, I am a religious mendicant, who, shuddering
at the victorious onslaught of age, disease and death, seeing
that all things are transient and permanence nowhere to be
found, have left the fetters of my home behind me that I may
search for some happiness that is trustworthy, that decays
not, that is imperishable, that looks with equal mind on friend
and enemy, and is regardless of wealth and beauty. Such
is the only happiness that will content me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Siddhartha in deep amazement on hearing thoughts
thus resembling his own, enquired eagerly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where, O wise man, do you seek it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great lord, I seek it in solitude, in the tranquillity of deep
woods, free from molestation. There in the Quiet dwells enlightenment.
And I carry this bowl that the charitable may
deposit an alms of food within it, and this is all I ask of the
world. And now, pardon haste, for my way lies onward to the
mountains where the true light awaits me, and joy for its
attendant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he passed onward and was no more seen, and it is
related that this ascetic was that divinity veiled in flesh who
had made known to the Prince the Three Terrors,—but this
I cannot tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Be he what he might, this man left behind him the first hope
that had enlightened the midnight of grief. And the Prince
said within his soul:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This too is a seeker, and this is the life I covet, for the
pleasures of earth are but sea-waters enraging the thirst they
seem to quench, and what now has life to offer but the search
for truth? Were there no others in the world but my son, my
father, my wife, then surely is it incumbent upon me to find
some means for their deliverance, but since the whole wide
earth weeps uncomforted, what a craven should I be, if I
spared to help it even with my blood and tears for unguents to
its wounds. The way most surely opens before me, and the
cry of the conquering ages is in my ears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after a time the Sakya lords, weary of their enjoyments,
gathered about him and the horses were harnessed, and all
returned to the city. And the people, rejoicing to see their
Prince, gathered to meet and greet him, and one fair lady,
leaning from a window, rejoicing in his beauty cried aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy be the father, happy the mother, happy the wife of
such a son and husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this word “happy” means also “freed,” for are not
freedom and happiness one? And taking her auspicious words
for the cry of freedom he looked up smiling into her eyes, and
said “Good is the teacher. Let this be her fee,” unclasped
his necklace of pearls and sent it to the happy lady and passed
on, forgetting, while she dreamed in vain of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all dispersed to their abodes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the next day the Prince entered into his father’s presence,
his face bright with resolution like the full moon, his
step strong and steady as the gait of the King of Lions, noble
and beautiful in strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And making due obeisance he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the Maharaj well and happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my son, and rejoicing to see your face so bright and
calm after long sorrow. Is the cloud past?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father, it is past in part. A clear way lies before me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That too is well. Praise to the Wielder of the thunder and
to all great Gods who hear our prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then tenderly, but with a calm immovable, the Prince declared
his heart’s desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O kind father, worthy of all obedience, hear my case. The
grief that has moved me is not my grief alone. Were I to
die, I can die silent, after the manner of our race. But a man,
when he beholds other men old, diseased, dying, is hurt,
ashamed, revolted that such things should be, and no way of
conquering such evils. There is a way if it could but be
found.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Maharaja replied with anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What way? This is child’s folly. These things have
been from Eternity, and men have faced the common lot as
best they could, taking their pleasure where they might.
What would you have more than others? Life is good, if
you will but see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Siddhartha answered steadfastly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O my father, I desire your august permission to seek the
solitude, and there, deeply meditating, to find true deliverance
not only for myself but for you and all the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the Maharaja heard these words—“to seek the
solitude” a great trembling of the heart seized him, and his
strong voice choked in his throat. And at last, even as the
mighty wild elephant shakes with his weight the boughs of
a fair green sapling in the jungle, he caught the hands of the
Prince and clung to them most pitifully, crying aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop. Let not such ill-omened words be spoken. The
time is not yet come—even if come it must. You are young
and full of life and your heart beats to a glad measure. If
you were to do this miserable thing you would bitterly repent
it. You have not the strength, nor the knowledge. This
is a resolution for old men, world-wearied. But you—beautiful
as the day, full of youth, husband of a fair and dutiful
wife, father of a young son, what talk is this? My son, I
am ashamed for you. It is for me to undertake the ascetic’s
life, for you to rule in Kapila. Let it be so, and I will
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Siddhartha holding his father’s hands tenderly replied
thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father, honoured and loved, you are the ruler and
what have I to do with putting you from your seat? No—far
be it from me! Rule in gladness and honour until the appointed
day. But for myself—there is but one condition on
which I can stay! If you will assure me against old age,
disease, and death, I will remain—but not otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Maharaja, blind with grief, the white hairs showing
on head and beard, said only:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such words are impious. Am I a God that I can say to
these three, ‘Thus far and no farther’? No—Betake yourself
to pleasure and business like other men and forget.
There is no other remedy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Siddhartha flung himself on his knees before his father
and grasped his robe in the agony of his pleading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, hinder me no more if you love me. If I were shut
in a burning home would you bar the door? Let me solve my
doubt for it consumes my very life. O let me go, let me go!
For if not—what way is left? Men have slain themselves for
a lesser hope than mine, that perhaps down the dark ways of
death they might seek and find what they could not in this
world of lies and counterfeits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he appealed in vain for the ears of his father were
sealed, and when after pleading even to anguish the Prince
had left him grave and silent, he issued orders that the Garden
House should be guarded more strictly than before—that fresh
dancers, fresh music, should be ordered and new pleasures invented
and that every road and way should be watched with
ten-fold diligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Siddhartha seeing the tears of his father with a compassion
that pierced his own heart returned to the Garden
House, and set himself in silence to consider, not knowing
whence help would find him, but firm in his resolve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And beneath the trees Yashodara awaited him, carrying his
young son in her arms, and she knelt beside him, uncovering
the face of the child, bright and beautiful as a budding rose in
earliest summer. For she thought—“Let this speak for me,”
and Siddhartha read the little face so like his own, in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, stretching out his hand, he clasped the hand of his
wife, and spoke thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well-beloved, if our child were in a house ruining about him,
and I stood by to see him crushed and broken, what would be
your thoughts of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled with pride and contentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why ask? That could not be. You would give your life
for him and count it nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well-beloved, mother of my son, that word is true; you
know it. And would you who love me hold me back if I
rushed on death for his sake, counting my own life as nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For my love’s sake I would bid you go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True again. So speak, so do the women of our race. But
hear further. Suppose my son fallen into bitter poverty, and
that I knew of a great treasure hidden in far-off forests and
mountains, so far that great was the danger, great the severance,
would you bid me stay or go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doubt clouded the beauty of her eyes, raised toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, my heart’s lord, I know not. You are more to my
son and me than any treasure. What are jewels, pearls or
gold compared with the heaven of your presence? Better
poverty together and the blue heaven above us and bright
earth beneath, than loneliness and splendour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clasping her hand he answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But starving, his face gaunt with want, haunted by ghosts
of grief and fear, would you send me or bid me stay? Think
well, mother of my son. Would you weigh your grief against
his good, and he too young to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would say, Go—how otherwise? But, O beloved, these
words are dreadful. Forget them. Look at the sunset strewing
roses on the cold snows and the splendour of Surya driving
his chariot down the western sky after the long day of glory.
He is weary of pomp and colour. He longs for the cool refreshing
dews and the dusk and quiet and the dark repose of
midnight. Would that we could see him face to face, golden-eyed
and inconceivably divine. The Gods are far and grief
is near.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He loosed her hand gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those words are true also, wise and beautiful.” And slowly
he added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Night comes and the Gods are far. Go in and sleep, beloved,—Yet
do not forget the words we have spoken together,
for grief comes to all and when it comes there is but one way—to
agree nobly with necessity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she took the dust from his feet, rapt on the beauty of
his eyes and went, carrying the child with her.</p>

<div><h1 id='pt2'>PART II</h1></div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On that night of terror and wonder were strange
influences astir in the darkness, influences moving
steadily to war. For the battle was not between the armies of
Kings nor was the prize a throne, but a combat strange, unearthly
between the armies of the Appetites and Desires, and
the warriors of the World of pure spirit and wisdom eternal,
and there and thus was it fought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the night of No Moon and the stars hung larger and
brighter, suspended but a little above the earth, and the dark
was still and breathless, so that Siddhartha would have willingly
sat all night by Rohini listening to the cool ripple of
water as she made her way through the gardens to an end
he knew not. But this could not be, for by the Maharaja’s
new orders the women must dog his footsteps, never permitting
him to wander, or remain unseen. And thus, though they were
invisible, he knew that bright eyes watched in every brake,
and feet light as a spirit’s trod noiselessly where he went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore at last, sighing, he rose and passed into the Hall
where the dancers stood ready to sway in their beautiful measure,
and the singers and musicians were ranged in order, fair
face outshining fair face until the most beautiful were nearest
to the gold cushions of his seat. But the Princess Yashodara
slept far off in the little marble chamber with her child clasped
to her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at last as the night went on a deep weariness oppressed
him and lay like lead on his eyelids, and the subtly stealing
dark and wearisome iteration of music and of rhythmic feet
became like an opiate, and his head dropped on the raised
pillows and he slept. So the dance slackened quietly and the
dancers whispered one to another:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How pale is the Prince! How careworn! Was it wise in
the Maharaj to hide from him what cannot be hidden? But
we are dancers—this is not our business. Do not wake him
lest there be anger. Mute the instruments very slowly and
softly and let none jangle as we lay it aside. We must not
leave him alone, lest suddenly he awake and demand more
pleasure, therefore remain here but be very quiet and, if it
be possible, sleep. O, it is good to rest. We too are weary
of singing and dancing. It is a hard service. Sleep, sisters,
sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it is told that when midnight drew veils of darkness over
earth and sky there came Influences noiseless—winged as the
white moth that haunts the evenings of summer, and that as
these came, thought died from the soul of Siddhartha and it
became Perception,—and he saw and heard inwardly while
the women about him lay drunk with heavy sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now along the night crept a strange music, thin at first and
faint as the far-off falling of rain, but drawing nearer, nearer,
sweeter than all harps and lutes struck with earthly hands,
and at first no words could be distinguished but only an unearthly
sweetness, soul-dividing, purer than the crystal purity
of ice on the highest summits of the mountains that speak
face to face with heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at last, the clear sounds glided into clear words, and the
Prince heard the mystic music, whether within or without his
soul who shall say? But it fell from on high like white flakes
of snow falling cold and passionless and drowning desire.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And when he heard and had understood this music, the
Prince rose from sleep and looked about him in the faint light
of the lamps, with thoughts new and awful stirring in his breast—thoughts
beyond words, unutterable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the women slept in disorder about him, heavily lolling
as though drunk with wine, their faces wried and twisted,
mouths awry, running over with saliva, limbs flung into coarse
attitudes, sprawling, couchant like animals, with pendant lips
and breasts, laughing foolishly at worthless dreams, hidden
blemishes visible, abandoned to the disclosures of careless sleep,
ungainly, revolting, as though the truth had suddenly touched
them with clear ray disclosing them as they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Prince said slowly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a graveyard, and these are the corpses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And shrinking in his very soul, he rose, looking down upon
them with horror, and drawing his feet and garments from the
contact went forth treading quietly and ascended to the roof
of the House of the Garden to look out into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dead silent was it as he turned to the eastern horizon, the
air breathless as though the Universe waited in suspense to
know what he would do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he, standing alone in the night, joined the ten fingers
of his hands, and rendered homage to all the Enlightened who
had preceded him, exalting and uniting his purpose to theirs
who had opened the way which the eternities shall not close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even as he joined his hands he perceived that the bright
star Pushya which had shone upon his birth was rising in the
sky, and he knew that his hour was upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then turning he descended, led by human anguish and longing
to see once more his young child and its mother, for in
the very deeps of his heart those lives were rooted, but, lest
resolution should waver, he went first to the doorway where
slept Channa the charioteer, wrapped in his white garment,
and even as the Prince stooped above him, this man sprang to
his feet, alert and faithful, saluting his Prince,—and in dim
lamplight each looked into the eyes of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Siddhartha said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O faithful! The blessing that is upon me has this night
touched perfection. Bring out my noble white horse, for my
life here is done and I depart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Channa stood perfectly silent staring in his face as
one bereft of purpose, and once more Siddhartha spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What must be, must. I thirst and long for a draught
of the Fountain of Sweet Dew. Delay no more. Saddle white
Kantaka. It is an order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Channa obeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the Prince entered the little marble chamber where on
her golden bed lay the Princess, drowned in sweet sleep, clasping
the child in her arms, unconscious of the grief approaching.
And it appeared to Siddhartha that the cold air of his sorrow
must rouse her, but it did not. She slept and smiled, rapt
in a dream of content. And garlands of flowers hung about
the chamber mingling their perfumes with the pure air of
night breathed through marble lattices, and all this was home
and his, and for the last time he looked upon it. And so
great a desolation fell upon him that twice he stretched his
empty arms to clasp the child in all its rosy warmth and dearness,
and twice they fell because he feared to wake Yashodara
from her last dream of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he stood, enduring, looking upon them as a man who
faces death and for a while he stayed, with thoughts that cannot
be told, nor should that veil be lifted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the end was come and he could endure no more,
he stooped above them until his breath mingled with theirs,
and turned away leaving them sleeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, passing through the quiet house, he came to the doorway
where stood white Kantaka, and Channa held him pale
as death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this horse was of all most noble, high-maned, with flowing
tail, broad-backed, wide-browed, with round and claw-shaped
nostrils, and he stood regarding his lord, and there was
prescience in his great eyes. And the Prince soothed and caressed
the strong neck, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O brave in fight and fearless, now put forth strength in
a sterner battle. To-night I ride far—even to the River of
Eternal Life. I ride far to seek deliverance—not for men
only, but for all your kind also. Therefore for your own sake,
great horse,—for the sake of all that draw the breath of life,
carry me far—far this night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, springing upon the noble horse, he settled himself in
the saddle, and pacing quietly the horse went on his way. So
they passed out dreamlike, the man like the sun shining forth
from his cloudy palaces, the horse like the white cloud beneath
him, drawing quiet breath because no sound must awake the
house of sleepers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it is told—but I know not—that four attendant divine
spirits laid their hands beneath the strong ringing hoofs to
deaden the sound, and that others, casting the watchmen into
sleep, caused the heavy barred gates to roll open slowly and
noiselessly. But be that as it will it is certain that the Prince
passed out, and gaining the road before the gates, stopped and
turned, saying these words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never again shall I come here—never again see this beloved
place, unless I conquer old age, disease, and death, for
this is my quest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it is told that divine voices in the air cried aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well done. Well said.” And whether the Prince heard
this or no I cannot tell, but he rode on his way. And man and
horse, strong of heart, went far that night, so far that when
the east flashed into light and the world-wide radiance of the
rising sun they stood beside great woods and the habitations
of those ascetics who had relinquished the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, wearied, the royal horse himself stopped, to draw
restful breath and to drink the pure lymph of those crystalline
streams. So the Prince dismounted and looking into the horse’s
eyes he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have borne me well.” And from that he turned to
Channa, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, O faithfullest, swift-footed as a bird is swift-winged,
long have you followed me, and even before this night
my heart was full of gratitude, and I knew you as a true man,—strong
of heart and strong of body. But now I know more,
for you have come with me utterly disdainful of profit, courting
danger and rebuke, and what shall I say to you? Many
words I cannot say—but only this. My heart will remember.
But, here we part—here is our relationship ended. Take my
horse and return. For me are births and deaths about to be
ended.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And taking off the chain of beaten gold and glimmering
jewels which he wore about his neck, he gave it to Channa,
saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take this in remembrance. Let it console your grief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then loosing the precious jewel that shone in his head-tire,
he looked at it lying in his palm where it flashed resplendent
like the sun of Indra’s Paradise, and he said slowly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take this, Channa, to my father and lay it reverently before
him. It is my heart. Tell him that I have entered upon
the life of the ascetic, not indeed seeking a heavenly birth, for
what is that to me if again I fall into rebirth and it leaves me
in this world of lies and illusions?—but that I may find the Way
of Deliverance. For if that way is found then no more need
I leave those whom I love; no more put away my kindred.
But since I must go, let not my father endure grief for me.
Let him forget me and be glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Channa, listening with reverence, tried to make his
voice heard, choking with grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will I do—but O the heaping up of sorrow! How
shall it be endured? Your father increases in years, your
son is but a little infant, the sister of your mother, who tended
your childhood, loves you as a son,—your wife, the mother of
your child—My Prince, my Prince!—think better before all
are lost. And drive me not from you. If I have been faithful
is not trust the reward of fidelity? O turn for pity’s sake: set
your face homeward. This I beseech you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Prince, pale and resolved, made answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is relationship? Were I to die I must leave them.
My own mother loved me, but she is vanished from among us.
The kinships of this world are like a flock of birds that for a
night settle on the same tree and when dawn comes disperse.
Such are its ties, no more. Does any tie of relationship ensure
the joy of permanent union? No. All is said. Say no more,
faithful one. Return to the city and make known to all men
these my words—‘When I have found the Way—that Way
which puts an end to the sad endless chain of birth and death,
then and not otherwise I will return.’ And if I do not obtain
this victory my body shall perish in the jungle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he turned to go, the horse, hearing, bent his head
and licked the foot of the Prince, and grief was seen in his large
eyes. So the Prince, fondly stroking his head, bade him also
farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My horse, gentle and noble, your good deeds have gained
their reward. No painful rebirth awaits you—this I know.
Be content, for it is well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then taking his jewelled sword, shining like a meteor, he
cut off the knot of hair which as a Prince he wore twisted with
jewels and even as he did this, there passed a hunter going toward
the jungle with bow and arrows and wearing a garment
of coarse yellow, and Siddhartha hailed the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend, will you change your garment for mine, for with
mine I have done for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the man drew near, consenting, and stripped off his
garment and took the other, and for a moment the two looked
each other in the eyes, Channa standing by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it is told—but this I cannot know—that this hunter
was the same divine spirit, who disguised in flesh had brought
enlightenment to the Prince, but be that as it may, he took the
garment and went his way in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And having made this exchange Siddhartha took off his jewels
one by one and placed them in the hands of Channa, and
stood a moment in the dull garment as it were a bright star in
eclipse, and so looked into the faithful eyes of Channa—as
though he would have spoken. But this he could not, then
slowly turning he made his way to the forest, and its boughs
and leaves opened to receive him, he parting them with his
hands, and he passed in and was seen no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Channa left alone, cried aloud</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raising his hands to the unpitying skies and letting fall his
arm on the neck of Kantaka, he stumbled homeward, his tears
falling, and great fear and grief possessing his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here and thus ends the scripture of the great Renunciation
leading us onward to the Discipline, the Enlightenment
and the Victory.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going deeper into the forest, calm and resolved in
mind, startling the deer as he passed, the birds rising
about him with cries, the Prince went on his way, plucking the
wild berries and fruits for food, he who had been served from
gold and silver, and the sun now fully risen poured floods of
light between the quivering leaves and ancient branches of
those venerable trees. And as he passed, seeing the world so
beautiful, dew trembling like crystals upon leaf and flower and
the perfume of the morning exhaling like the breath of a
maiden in pure mist, the beginning of peace rose in his troubled
mind, and he said within himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a great storm comes calm. Let me now control my
grief, remembering that the past returns no more than Rohini
after she has flowed into the ocean. And as in the ocean
drifting logs for awhile meet and touch and are then driven
apart by the waves so is it with parents, wives, children and
wealth. This is most true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when at noon he was weary and his feet torn with the
strong thorns and hooks of jungle creepers he sat down to rest
and the thought came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were I now in the sweet garden by Rohini how would my
wife, soft-handed, gentle-voiced, weep to see these feet, with
what cool dropping unguents would she staunch the blood,
which now I have not so much as a rag to wipe away.”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, seeing this and waiting his opportunity Mara the Tempter—that
One evil from of old, drew near through the shining
trees, and whether he spoke within or without the heart of
Siddhartha I cannot tell, but most certainly he spoke and his
voice at first distant as the humming of ardent black bees about
a flower became nearer, sweeter, subtle, until it sealed every
sense to all but its meaning. And thus he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Prince, merciful and compassionate but utterly misled,
what is it you would do in the wild forest? Is this a place
for a ruler of men? Far be it from you! By what evil
counsel do you abandon your duties, flinging all madly aside
to become an ascetic? What reason is there in believing that
pain and destruction of the body give wings to the soul? No—but
far otherwise, for the soul dwindles with the tortured
body as flame dies when it has consumed the fuel. And if your
aim be to benefit mankind, are not just and powerful Kings
needed, and was it not foretold at your auspicious birth that you
would become an empire-ruling King? Here—living and dying
in the jungle, how is your might wasted, and the people
forsaken!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the voice grew sweeter and more poignant and verily
before him did Siddhartha see the face of the Tempter, beautiful
and melancholy with pleading mouth and eyes that entreated
and hands spread out in prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think better, O Prince. Consider how the kingdom of
Kosala lies near to Kapila and easily to be captured. Great
are the cities of Kosala. Consider the city of Ayodhya—in
length it is eighty-four miles, in breadth seventy, and the
streets so broad that a team of elephants—nay two; might be
easily driven abreast, and flowering trees stand along them,
and there are rows of stalls to which the wealthy merchants
flock from all the countries of the world, from China and Lanka
and down the Passes from Balkh and Samarkhand; their caravans
of camels and horses carrying such rarities as kingly
hearts desire. There are gardens and mango groves for the
delight of the citizens and clear waters where they may sport
like swans and other aquatic birds, and mountain-like palaces
adorned with pinnacles and banners and glittering with precious
inlay,—and great houses where skilled actors delight
their hearers with song and dance and story, so that eye and
ear are transported in seeing and hearing. And there is a
quarter of the city where dwell women of beauty exceeding the
Apsaras, for they are brought from the ends of the earth to
delight the happy people of Kosala. And the town is thronged
with splendid elephants and horses; and neighbouring kings,
decked with earrings and armlets, come to pay tribute and
marvel at the glittering beauty of the city. There is no want
of food and the very water is sweet as the juice of the sugar-cane,
and night and day the air resounds with music and
stringed instruments. And all this is yours for the taking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And heart-enthralling was the picture that rose before the
Prince’s eyes in hearing, for he beheld Yashodara a Queen
beside him, fair and royal, example to women, and between his
knees his son Rahula proud and gentle—a great King to be, and
a happy people sheltered in his shadow—a noble people enlightening
the dark tribes about them. And the soft voice proceeded
like the breathing melody of a flute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor are the Gods forgotten in the city of Ayodhya; great
reverence is done them, and were a royal saint upon the throne,
crime would be banished and forgotten and the Golden Age
return to earth. O bountiful and merciful, all this is in your
hands. There also are troops of noble Brahmans, celebrated
for learning and piety, for it were shame indeed if greatness of
mind and soul were forgotten in the pleasure of the senses.
No—far otherwise. And with such wisdom, there is no poverty,
for every householder is rich in horses and cattle and
food. All possess earrings and garlands, each is content with
his own gains, free from covetousness, speaking the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the sweet subtle voice ceased the Prince replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it is only I who shall be covetous—I, who must plunge
this happy city in blood and tears that I may take it to be
my slave? And the King who has made them happy I must
slay. Is this what you would have me do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Tempter replied gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prince, there is no good but what it might be better, and
if that King is wise you are wiser. Turn again to Kapila and
to glory, and to the good of mankind and this that I promise
shall befall in seven days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then summoning his fortitude, Siddhartha said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This city filled with pleasure, beauty and wealth, with wisdom
and content,—is it safely protected, O wise one? Is it
well fortified against attack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And eager was the voice of the Tempter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well asked, O Prince, and wisely. It is fortified as never
city in the world’s history. About it goes a mighty wall where
the King’s chariots may drive abreast, and about that a moat
wide and deep, and there is a host of warriors, each able to
combat with a thousand. Never city so safe. Nor could even
yourself conquer it did I not give you friends within the gates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then is it certain that age, disease and death, those fell
enemies, must needs stay outside? They cannot enter in this
guarded city?” So said the Prince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence. And presently Siddhartha answering the
subtle voice said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go from me, thou Ancient Evil! The snare is set too
plain. For all their wealth this miserable people must suffer
and decay and die like all the world and their riches are but
a pang the more. Truly one day I may come to Ayodhya and
as a conqueror bringing great riches in my hand for their good,
but not thus—not thus!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in his heart the subtle voice was stilled and he rose
and went on his way with bleeding feet. And as he went he
said this to himself:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before the days when I considered the terrors of re-birth,
old age, disease and death, I sought after such merchandise
as the merchandise of Kosala, subject to all these lures. But
now, seeing the danger, awake and alert, let me seek only after
the things which have no part in these, even the supreme joy
and security of the Peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though he did not know it, that Tempter followed, for
who is immune from his arts, and he thought, watching the
serenity of the Prince:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This time he has conquered, but sooner or later even if
riches fail some hurtful or malicious thought will burn within
him and then—then he is mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And from that hour he crept behind the Prince on the watch
for sin, cleaving to him like a shadow which follows the object
from which it falls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So after long journeying he came to Rajagriha—name never
to be forgotten because once the Light of the world sojourned
there. And this was the capital of King Bimbisara, King of
Magadha, and it lay very pleasantly in an eastern valley of
holy Ganges, surrounded by the five mountains of the Vindhya
range, and these are beautiful though but as foothills comparing
them with those great ramparts of the Gods—the mountains
beyond Kapila.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now in these Vindhya mountains are caves in the lower
hills, all grown about by trees, in the solitude yet not so far
but what an ascetic may go to the city if needful, and in these
caves certain learned and holy Brahmans had established themselves
and to each came disciples, counting this world as husks
if they might rise to the heavens on strong wings of knowledge
and belief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming wearily through the forest, pale and worn with unused
hardships, the Prince climbed upward to the caves shaded
by great trees and in an excellent quiet, and at last before
him he saw the mouth of a cave hung with vines and grown
about by bushes in blossom, and before it sat a man clothed
in a garment of red bark, and he was in the lotus posture to
ward off evil, and the Prince seeing him thus meditating passed
around him respectfully three times and took his seat in silence
at a proper distance, waiting his pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So time went by, and the ascetic never stirred though his
shadow shifted as the sun went on his golden journey westward,
and Siddhartha meditated on the Way of Peace, wondering
if the man before him had its key, and to him too the
time was not long, and the cool shade bathed his wounded
feet and refreshed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at last the ascetic returned to earth and looked at him
with visionary incurious eyes while the Prince waited respectfully,
and finally he accosted Siddhartha, asking what had
brought him hither, to whom the Prince dutifully replied, for
a teacher is more even than a parent, being a spiritual and
not a fleshly father, and he besought his instruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And having heard, the Brahman Alara considered awhile,
and agreed that he should study the Vedas and Upanishads,
those ancient holy scriptures, under his guidance and amid
the families of holy persons, both men and women, who dwelt
in the caves and woods each engaged in religious duties and
pursuing the way to Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Prince, with folded hands, said humbly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am but a beginner, great sir; I do not know the rules of
the religious life. Be pleased to grant me information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that twice-born Brahman of high lineage informed Siddhartha
of the rules of the various teachers and of the fruits
expected from their practices. He declared how some lived
only on food proceeding from pure water, some subsisting on
edible roots and tender twigs, others on fruits and flowers
some, like deer, eating grass and herbs, others again begging
their food and giving it in charity, keeping only the crumbs
and remnants for themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also he named those ascetics who torture the body in order
to subdue it, those who let water drop continually on their
heads—and many more, cunning in devising sufferings and
cruel austerities, so that at the end of every life they may
purchase birth in Heaven and taste divine tranquillities and
pleasures before they are again launched into the dreary sea
of mortal existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thus,” he said, “are great joys attained, impossible
to be described in words, delectable to the soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Prince heard with reverence, and the ascetics, men
and women who dwelt in the woods and caves, seeing the beauty
of his face and his serenity and courtesy were moved with
wonder and admiration, saying—“Who is this most beautiful
young man, so calm and noble? Surely he has the appearance
of a great Prince and can be no other. Well is it when
such forsake the world’s things for the things of the Gods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his master appointed a cave for his dwelling tapestried
with nests of the wild black bees, and dripped about in one
part with golden honey, but because the holy men were friendly
to all creatures and disturbed none of their combs but only ate
a little of the dripped honey, the bees were friendly also and
pleasant companions, their myriad voices soothing to meditation
as the sounds of a great ocean far off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here dwelt Siddhartha joining in the strong chanting of
Vedic hymns and hearing the recital of the Vedas and Upanishads,
for books were none—the memories of men carrying all
knowledge, and he learnt these things with a swiftness almost
incredible, because his heart was in it. And when food was
needed, clad in his yellow garment he took his begging bowl,
and went down to the city begging from house to house, for
he considered thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Full of hindrances is the household life; the haunt of passion.
Free as air is the homeless state,” and all the luxuries
of his former life seemed empty as a dream that flies at dawn.
“Better is the alms of food I beg than the wines and fruits
cooled in snow, the rich meats and costly of Kapila.” So he
said night and day, though at first his soul loathed the food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now one day when he went to the town of Giribaja to beg
his food it so happened that the King of Magadha, Bimbisara,
stood on the high terrace of his palace, looking down the
street, and he saw the young ascetic coming slowly, holding his
bowl in his hands and courteously accepting what was given.
And there was that in the nobility of his person and evident
signs of Aryan birth which arrested the eyes of the King and
he said to those about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look upon this man, lords, beautiful is he, great and pure.
He is guarded in conduct: his eyes do not wander, he looks
not more than a fathom’s length before him. Such a man is
of no low caste. See how, like a great noble, he is self-possessed
and serene, moving in solitary majesty as the moon
among faint stars. Send my royal messengers and inquire
where that mendicant goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the messengers ran at the King’s word and hurried
down into the street saying to one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is that Bhikkhu<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> going? It is toward the mountain
Pandava. That must be his abode.”</p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f1'><a href='#r1'>[1]</a></span>

Monk.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>And having followed where Siddhartha went they returned
to the King and told him—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the eastern slope of Mount Pandava that Bhikku has
taken his seat, a King among men as the tiger among beasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the King said, “Bring out my chariot,” and he directed
it to the mountain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now when the road ended he did not return discouraged but
dismounting went onward climbing up on foot until he came
near to where the Prince sat, and there with eagerness and
courtesy the King greeted him, for as lions know their kind,
not mistaking them for jackals, so is it with the great. And
the King took his seat on a rock, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beseech you, sir, to tell me your family and lineage.
Young are you, a man in his first youth, fine and delicate in
colour, the glory of the vanguard of an army. I would lay
wealth at your feet, if wealth delighted you. Speak, and tell
me your mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he spoke the nobles stood grouped about to hear,
correcting every careless or unseemly gesture because the
man was great and the very air about him pure, and they
beheld with joy his noble body bright as gold, his eyes of
darkest blue, and the kingliness of his manners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Prince replied with gratitude and noble courtesy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great King, kind and liberal is your heart, and precious
your generosity to my own, but all these things lie behind me
far as dawn from sunset. I had wealth and power, and more,
but regarding these things as hindrances to perception I am
come out into the solitude to seek the Way of Peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And having thus begun he related to the King his family
and history and all about them held breath to listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the King, sighing, at last said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noble one, I cannot but reverence your choice yet I lament
it, for the world has need of you. I would share my kingdom
with you could that shake your resolution. There is nothing
I could refuse would it draw you to us again for I see you
surpassing other men and have not known your like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the steadfast Prince replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Illustrious and world-renowned, descendant of Arya, your
words are heard with deep veneration. Righteous and sincere,
you speak the truth, and virtue is not confined to any
one school of thought—the sun lights the whole world and
the Way of a great and just king is blessed. But for me, I
have heard a call. My way is onward and behind me lie
the Five Desires. Would a hare rescued from a serpent’s
jaws go back to be devoured? As little would I return to the
dreams and illusions that have fallen from me. King, there
are many quests and mine is to find deliverance for the world
from the Wheel of Agony that turns and turns and will not
cease through pitiless ages of rebirth and sorrow. There is
a way,—and I have given all that I may find it. But you—return,
O wise King, to your happy city. May you direct
and defend your subjects in peace. May the Gods be good
to you. May all good go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the King replied with gratitude and noble courtesy
said these words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That which you seek, great Prince, may you attain, receiving
the perfect fruit of your birth. And when this is
gained I pray you return to me that I also may share in your
wisdom, and graciously receive me as one who would learn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the Prince rising, with courteous salutations, pursued his
way to the solitude, and the King and his nobles with folded
hands followed a little way in reverence and then with
thoughtful and mindful hearts returned to the city.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So while the Prince went on into the woods, turning
his steadfast face to the dawn of Enlightenment,
Channa the charioteer went slowly back to Kapila, grieving
and weeping, leading the noble horse, for he had most surely
hoped that where his lord went he might follow, having proved
himself faithful; and as the darkness of night closed in upon
him he wavered, halting and looking behind him and then
again proceeding, irresolute in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the horse also grieved for his master, going heavily, his
head bowed that was held so nobly, neither would he eat
grass nor drink water, and no joy nor spirit were left in him,
for he thought “I shall never see him again.” And even as
he thought this, his great heart broke for grief, and he died.
But in a happy place was he reborn because of his fidelity,
even as the Prince had foreseen, for in no world can love
lose the blessedness of its love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Channa went yet more slowly, weeping a second sorrow,
and to him the land appeared withered as when a man returns
to a ruined city which once he knew glad and living, and it
seemed as though the sun hidden behind a mountain no longer
enlightened the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the men about the way, seeing him in grief, turned
again to look, and consternation seized them and one cried
aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is the Prince—beloved of the world? Have you
taken him away by stealth? Where is he hidden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Channa halting, said with sighs;</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I who followed him always with a loving heart, would
I have left him? Little do you know me! He has dismissed
me,—O men of Kapila! He has buried himself in the forests
to live the life of an ascetic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And those who listened heard this with dark foreboding,
for it appeared to them that things deep, strange, and mysterious
had suddenly appeared in their way, and that the very
world had changed in its course if such things could be.
What had there been lacking to the Prince that he should go
out thus to seek it? What had he beheld, invisible to them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the news spread from them to the city and men and
women rushed out to the gates, and when they saw that
Channa wept as he returned in loneliness, they, not understanding
whether the Prince was dead or alive, cried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has befallen? Surely sorrow is added to sorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And like the flash of lightning news spread to the House
of the Garden and the women of the palace, their hair dishevelled
about them, their robes flung hastily on as for a
night-alarm, came pouring down to the doors that they might
hear the worst, and when they saw the charioteer alone, they
raised a loud and bitter cry. So women mourn the beloved
dead when hope itself is dead with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the cry reached Prajapati, aunt and foster-mother of
the Prince, sister of Maya his mother, and she wept, saying
to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas—his beauty, his beauty! O my son, who was there
to compare with him? I see his dark locks bound with gold,
his eyes blue and deep as the Ox-King’s, his broad shoulders
and strong arms, a Tiger-King among men. How can it be
endured that you should suffer the chills and heats of the
forest and we, bereft and miserable, see you no more!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the great lady threw herself upon the earth and so lay,
with the women sitting about her, held motionless by strong
grief, as marble images.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when at last one gathered up courage to tell the
Princess she sent for Channa, towering in indignation above
him like an angry Queen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O faithless man, and trusted in vain! evil contriver, false
servant!—beneath these pretended tears there is a hidden
smile. You went out with him and alone you return. What
have you done? Better an open enemy than a false friend.
Alas, the sorrows of our line! Surely his noble mother died
foreseeing the grief of to-day, for our house is left unto us
desolate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Channa, pierced to the soul and thunderstruck, was
silent, and she spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You weep aloud now. Why did you not awake the Palace
when he went? Then all might have been saved. Now
it is too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, folding his hands, with no anger in his heart, for the
agony of the Princess was visible, the true Channa replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Lady, have pity on my grief, for I am innocent in
this. In my soul I believe it was the Gods’ doing. From
the day of his birth there have been portents, and who was
I to stand against it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Princess, just and noble of soul, recollected herself,
regretting her words, knowing well that the burden of
the Gods’ purpose is their own and cannot be charged upon a
man, and she spoke gently to him, and when he was gone
she sat alone mourning, recalling the face and voice of her
Prince, and slowly as the strong grief overburdened her she
slipped down strengthless from the golden cushions and lay
upon the ground, her empty arms stretched out before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So her women found her, and as they raised her tenderly,
she said this only:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take away my golden bed where my lord and I lay, for
henceforth I will lie upon bare earth. Take away my robes of
silk and my jewels and bring me the yellow robe of the mendicant,
for I am beggared indeed. Henceforth I will wear no
other. Cut off my long hair, for I have done with beauty.
And once a day and once only, bring me the food of the
mendicant, such as will keep the flame of life alight and no
more, for as to pleasure, the name of it is forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as she said so was it done, and the long and perfumed
tresses that touched her lovely feet fell about her like a
dropped veil, and thus she lived henceforward, and for her
child’s sake only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as to the Maharaja his case was different, for love and
anger contended in him, and his thoughts charged each other
as in battle, rushing madly hither and thither like a herd of
wild elephants. And when his nobles gathered about him he
raged aloud before them:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once I had a son. Now I have none. What is my kingdom
to me, and my horribly echoing empty palace? And
what are rule and dominance? Why was he given to be
taken?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And for all the royal priest and the wise minister could do,
they could not assuage his wrath and grief until the thought
occurred to them that they might follow the wanderer and
yet compel or persuade him to return. Then, and then only,
the King listened:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go,” he said, “and swiftly. Let not a breath intervene
between now and your going, for life is unendurable until
you return with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So in great haste the priest and minister set out on the
way indicated by Channa, counting every instant of time
they lost precious as dropped grains of pearl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when they were come to the forests and hills of
Rajagriha, they asked their way of the wandering religious
persons whom they met, and of the cave-dwelling ascetics,
and to these grave persons they said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are come, beseeching your aid. We serve a King like
to the greatest of the Gods and his son, beautiful as the God
who pierces hearts, has forsaken us and gone out into the
solitudes seeking a remedy against old age, disease, and death,
a thing no man can find. Knowing this, tell us, we entreat,
where we may find him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the ascetics replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know him and his beauty and nobleness. He is gone
to the cave of Alara the Brahman that he may seek for
illumination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely giving themselves time to hear and to utter thanks
those two old men, the priest and minister, hurried on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now as they did so the awe of the place and its quiet and
the spirit of deep contemplation arising from the residence of
so many holy persons fell on them, and insensibly their speed
slackened, and neither said this to the other, but the same
influence was upon them both, and as they had abandoned
the royal chariot when the track ceased, so also they now
divested themselves of the insignia of their high offices, and
advanced humbly towards their destination. And as they
went they saw a young ascetic seated beneath a tree, his
hands folded and eyes fixed upon the running water of a
stream before his feet, and he heard their steps and rising
saluted them, and it was their Prince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surely words cannot tell how this sight moved them—they
who had seen him far otherwise, who perceived about him
now a difference immeasurable even in thought!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they saluted him with more than the old obedience,
and being hidden took their seats beside him as the twin
stars attend the moon. And about them was the vast quiet
and silence and shadow of the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then choosing their words with care as a warrior chooses
the arrows that shall lose his life or save it, in turn they set
before him the condition of his father the King, asking him
with deep earnestness how it could be right in his eyes to
abandon all his duties, inflicting sorrow worse than death
upon those he loved and left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when they had spoken, only the little running water
took up the tale for the Prince meditated upon their words,
and they dared not interpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a long interval he raised his head and answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is well spoken, but I have entered the road wherein
is no turning. For it is not for myself only that I seek the
remedy, but for all creation. And to me the earth is filled
with this thought and with this only, and however you may
use the sorcery of words to bewilder me it fails. I have heard
and I will again hear your plea, but this is and will be my
answer—The sun, the moon, forsaking the sky, may fall to
earth, the snowy mountains topple from their base, but I will
never change my purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And having said this he rose, and the two with him, and
they, seeing that they broke themselves against rock, answered
gently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Prince, it is enough. No more remains to be said.
We will intrude our presence on you no more, but will return
to the King and lay your fixed resolution before him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they saluted him, and returned slowly through the
forest, pausing here and there as they went to speak with the
calm and untroubled inhabitants who therein sought the
treasure of wisdom, eager to understand from them if possible
the teaching which as the nectar of flowers draws the
bee, had drawn the Prince to the homeless life. Hard was
it to comprehend, and at last, sad and bewildered, they
emerged from the green ocean of leaves to the light of common
day and mounting the chariot, plied lash and shout
hastening homeward, and thus was the last tie with Kapila
broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Prince remained behind them, upborne by the
love of those he had forsaken, a love too great for them and
such as they to comprehend.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then for patient years. Siddhartha, the Buddha
to be,—struggled to the light in the forest, finding
none. Surely was this the dark night of the soul wherein
not so much as a star gleams in the thick and stifling midnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Alara he studied long and patiently, so mastering his
system of thought that the ascetics who followed Alara besought
the Prince to become their master. But this he would
not, for he discerned no finality in this teaching, nor any real
deliverance, because desire is not extinguished even though
it be for high things, and though it be held but by a finger
the ego of man is drawn again and yet again into the revolving
wheel that mangles him,—the wheel of birth and
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore abandoning the teacher Alara he went sorrowfully
on to the teacher Uddaka, that wise dweller in solitude,
and with him he studied in patience, hoping yet against hope
that here at last might be the beginning of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he mastered this system also, confronting his instructor
with difficulties which could be neither explained nor overcome,—finding
that Uddaka promised a glittering heaven not
founded upon the Unchangeable, but transitory, vanishing,
illusory. And here too the Way was not, nor the unchanging
Law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then at last on his long patience dawned a certainty—that
no help was in any son of man, that the riddle was too
high for them and their wings fluttered lamed in the blue
and awful heights where his own thoughts soared—and that
even this height was not high enough. And within himself
he said:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I have learned here I have learned and there is no
more. The pasture is eaten bare. I will go on alone into
the forests of Uruvela and there I will practise a terrible
asceticism beyond all I have seen in Rajagriha, for it may be
these men are right who teach that in the destruction of the
body lies enfranchisement of the soul. I cannot tell, but I
will pass by no opening which may set my feet in the Way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So travelling alone (for he said in his heart:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better
or his equal let him steadfastly keep to his solitary journey:
there is no companionship with a fool.”) He came at last
to the town of Uruvela, and when he saw the place he
loved it, and long afterwards, when Enlightenment was come
he spoke of it thus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, O disciples, I thought within myself, Surely this is
a place dear and delightful. The forest is wide and deep.
There flows a pure river, with little creeks where a man may
bathe, and fair lie the villages of the simple people. This is
a good place for one in search of deliverance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was very weary, and often he said to his heart:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long is the night to him who is awake, long is a mile to
him who is tired, long is life to him who knows not the true
Law. O that it would shine upon me in this gross darkness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there in the great woods he set himself to a cruel discipline
so that other wood-dwellers marvelled at his austerities
though themselves treading a painful way. And of these
were in especial five, of whom more hereafter. And they
established themselves within reasonable distance, hoping to
learn from him when he should attain, and talking with him
of great things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So by the river in the forest composing his body and mind
he set himself to contemplation lessening his food little by
little daily until he subsisted on a morsel incredible to the
mind of man, and even this he would have spared had it been
possible that the attenuated body could still have caged the
soul. And after awhile he spoke to no man, sitting lost in
far-off regions they could not enter, even controlling his
breath so that scarcely could he be said to breathe at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So still, so motionless, he sat day-long that he became a
part of nature as much as the tree that sheltered him, and
the creatures of the forest moved about him unafraid. The
furry mothers brought their cubs to nestle by his feet, and
winged mothers lit upon his shoulders to call their broods,
and at his feet the wild peacock outspread his jewelled fans,
and fear was unknown in the still presence of the Bodhisattva—the
Buddha-to-be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far and wide spread the fame of this great and noble
ascetic in the woods of Uruvela, and persons would journey
from the city that they might stand far off and see him lost
in meditation, and when, looking timidly through the boughs,
they beheld his starved body like a withered tree and his calm
unseeing eyes they were moved with wonder and compassion,
and went away very softly, in their hearts entreating his
prayers and blessings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But lost in deep meditation Siddhartha was beyond prayer
or blessing and whether they came or went, he neither saw
nor knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Making his way perfect through the disentangling powers of
wisdom, fasting cruelly, yet not trusting in this austerity for enfranchisement,
he strengthened in heart and wisdom even as his
body weakened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And first he meditated on transience, and all about him confirmed
the truth, for nothing stayed but all became and passed
instantly, never resting, into further becoming. About him
the seasons trod their quiet round. Scarcely had the young
spring burst into blossom, when, before she had leisure to
mirror her beauty in the river at his feet, she was lost in the
burning splendour of summer, and this passed without pause
or division into the gold and orange fruitage of autumn and
the passionate weeping of the rains, and so ended in the
temperate sweetness of winter, there to recommence the
eternal Wheel of Change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he thought: “There is no being, for all is becoming.
On what shall we build?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And before him the spider spun her frail thread, glittering
with morning dew, lovely as a queen’s garments in the pale
morning gold that filtered through green leaves. And so in
a moment it was gone. And he thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely the existence of man is frailer. A blow, a breath
of pestilence and he lies broken, an offence to the earth. To
appear, to disappear. Such is the history of man as of the
meanest of insects.” And before his strained perception unrolled
itself the whole vast phantasmagoria of thought like a
veil hung to conceal the Permanent, the Eternal, and he could
not penetrate behind it. Before him were the steps by which
the creature ascends to the Source, but in the height they
dissolved into vapour and dispersed into cloud and there was
no way there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And sometimes so present were the evil and pain of life to
his vision, so unescapable their presence, that for a space
it seemed the perfection of divine attainment was but an infinite
of the first power, but evil and pain an infinite of
immeasurable power, terrible in perfection. And to a lesser
than the Bodhisattva this must have brought madness or despair,
but strong as an eagle to the sun he outsoared the dark
clouds. And unknown to himself nature spread her guards
about him. In the rising of the moon was peace and her
light shed tenderer dreams like the soft falling of snow, and
the strong leap of the sun at dawn in the first of his three
strides, was the outrush of hope—hope unfulfilled but ever
on before. And the breeze was good to him, laying a cool
hand on weary temples, and the singing of the river overflowed
from the very heart of quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as the tapestry of life unrolled its pictures before his
eyes he read its lesson. Happiness is a dream and sorrow a
truth and individual life a misfortune from which impersonal
contemplation is the only enfranchisement. Could this be
true? Could it be possible that a barren soul, a proud and
complete selfishness and heedlessness of all other sufferers
than himself, disdain of the crowd and indifference to all that
the vulgar covet, represent the only escape for the wise man
from the entanglements of Maya—Illusion? No—a thousand
times no! Better to drop into the jaws of darkness and be extinguished
than remain petrified and apart in a world where
men must bleed and die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then is goodness itself a lie? Is man the eternal dupe of
words and phrases contrived to make us docile to suffering as
slaves to the whip? Is hope but a watery rainbow painted on
a dissolving cloud? Is the Way itself a dream begotten of
Misery, the Mother, and Pride, the father—Pride that will have
man think himself a something when in reality he is nothing
and his fate concerns the universe as much as blown grains
of sand in a whirlwind, rising and settling as aimlessly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at such times the Bodhisattva felt the endless turning
of the Wheel within his own soul, and a vertigo of perception
seized him as the Infinities gazed over his head in untroubled
calm, and only the Wheel turned and turned in merciless revolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then were it not better to submit to passive ignorance and
fight no more? To sink into wearied submission, accepting
the lash and fetter for doom? For each life is built up of
millions, and where is the redemption for its infinite littleness?
Let all pass for all is nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at such times he steadied himself upon the thought of
Law. Could a man nobly agree with necessity which is the
other name of Law, were that no peace and enlightenment?
Is not Law beheld in nature? What is this incessant changing
yet unchanging series of phenomena unperplexed by self-contemplation
and analysis which man sees about him. What?
Is it a play—a spectacle that Brahm the Universal Spirit
has set in motion for Its own delight, or is it Itself expanded
throughout the Universe, and if this be so is man the one
thing outside Its circumference, and if he be within it, shall
he only be ignorant of the Law and agonized because he does
not obey it? If man is capable of conceiving the Law surely
it exists and is his and him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he looked down the abyss and beheld nothing but persistence
in change and the infinity of infinities. Was there
anywhere a fixed point? Surely only in the relation of all
to Law. Therefore he hungered and thirsted for Law, forgetting
the emaciation of his body and its pitiable weakness,
thirsting for the Way with a deathly thirst that consumed
him, rendering him incapable of all other suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though he knew full well and each day perceived more
clearly that the climax of wisdom is perception of this universal
Law from which nothing—no, not the very soul of man
is exempt—still it evaded him. Freedom from deception he
attained, diamond-clear lucidity, certainty that there is a first
principle and final aim of the Universe, but the Way to touch
hands with it he could not find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, having caught but a glimpse of the Absolute like a
star in driven clouds, he had gained the certainty of what is
not, but not as yet the knowledge of what is, and there even
the majesty of the Bodhisattva’s<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> intellect fell back baffled,
and at last his mind became like a dimness in which thought
itself lost its way and analysis stumbled, and the clear call
became like the falling of a great water in which many sounds
fuse into a confused roar in which nothing but mere noise is
to be discerned, deafening the ears and confusing the senses.</p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f2'><a href='#r2'>[2]</a></span>

The Buddha-to-be.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>And thus he sat for six long years, and at the end though
he had discerned the perishable, the transient, the Eternal Way
was far from his perception, and life rushed by him from an
unknown beginning to a hopeless end, defending itself frantically
for a few brief years, but in the end conquered, and the
man broken in the frail edifice which is called his being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now he was so wasted that life hung in him by a thread
worn slender as a spider’s, and the fame of his terrible austerities
had spread like the sound of a great bell hung in the
canopy of the skies, and if he had gained what he sought all
this would have counted as nothing in his eyes, but in the long
six years he had not gained, and his mind tortured him because
now it seemed that it broke itself and its power dispersed like
a mighty wave broken on rocks and fleeing in foam and spray.
And one day when he rose to his feet, still drowned in hopeless
meditation, his limbs failed beneath him, and he fell and
so lay exhausted, spent, believing “This is death, and I am
conquered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it could not be otherwise for very terrible had been his
austerities and later he told his disciple this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember when a crab-apple was my only daily food. I
remember when a single grain of rice was my only grain of
food. And my body became extremely thin and lean. Like
dried withered reeds my arms and legs, my hips like a camel’s
hoof, like a plait of hair my spine. As project the rafters of
a house’s roof, so raggedly stuck out my ribs. As in a deep-lying
brook the watery mirror beneath appears so small as almost
to disappear, so in the deep hollows of my eye-pits my
eye-balls well nigh wholly disappeared. As a gourd becomes
shrivelled and hollow in the hot sun so did the skin of my head
become parched. And pressing my stomach my hands touched
my spine, and feeling my spine my hand felt through to the
stomach. And yet with all this mortification I came no nearer
to the supernatural faculty of clearness of knowledge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So for a long time he lay in the borderland of death, and had
this been the end—O Light of the World extinguished, O Sun
set at dawn!—but it was not to be, and slowly, very slowly,
consciousness returned, and his heavy eyelids lifted and once
more he beheld the light. And he thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I could creep down to the river the waters, warm and
kindly, would refresh me, and thought would perhaps return
to me, and a little rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And painful inch by inch Siddhartha crept down to the river,
supporting himself as he went by the extended hands of
branches, and in a warm shallow of water, sparkling in green
shade he lay, foredone, and it flowed about him gently, bringing
healing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the five ascetics watching him from far off said to each
other:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will die now; the ascetic Gotama will die now. It is
not possible that a man so worn and exhausted should
live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And indeed, when he tried to struggle up and leave the kindly
water, there was no strength in him and he could not rise. And
it is told that a heavenly spirit pressed down a branch that he
might reach it and support himself. This it is certain he did,
laying hold on a bough which dipped over its own image in
still water, and he crept up the bank, dizzily, and seated himself
beneath a tree, supporting his weakness against it, with
closed eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, being refreshed, he had power to reflect, and he
said within himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way of mortification has failed me also. Like other
ways I have sought this beats against a shut door and there
is no help in it. My body is so broken that it can no longer
support the intellect. I will eat and drink and strengthen this
tortured body that it may still be the servant of the higher in
me, no longer complaining of its own griefs and diverting attention
from the goal. For it is possible that what I have already
learned has prepared the way to Right Ecstasy and that
in ecstasy I may behold the beginning of the Wisdom which
in all the methods I have tried has been hidden from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even as he thought this the strong weakness overwhelmed
him again and he could think no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, on the other side of the wood dwelt a chief herdsman,
very wealthy in cattle and rice, owning land far-spreading and
fertile in the rich water-meadows by the river, and he had a
daughter fair and wise, named Sujata. And reaching womanhood
this fair maiden had made a vow to the Tree-Spirit of the
forest, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I should wed a husband of equal rank with myself and
my first-born should be a son, then would I make a noble offering
every year, never forgetting the benefit.” And this
prayer was heard, and her first-born son lay upon her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So wishing to make her offering on the day of the full moon,
she pastured a thousand cows in the woods, and with their
milk she nourished five hundred cows, and with theirs two
hundred and fifty, drawing life through life until at last she
possessed eight cows thus fed on the strength and life of a
thousand, and no purer nor stronger milk could be. And this
being ready Sujata rose earlier than dawn and, went to the byre
with her pails, and as she came near the milk flowed in streams
without milking, even as when the calves crowd for their food
about their mothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she took it and placed it in a new vessel and added rice,
and herself made a fire and cooked it. And the bubbles rose
and froth, but not a drop ran over the brim, and the fire burned
clear and steady without smoke or blackness. And as a man
crushes golden honey from the comb that has formed about
a stick—the very essence of honey—so into that pure food
was infused a marvellous sustenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Sujata said to her waiting-maid, Punna:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Punna, dear girl, surely the deity is auspiciously disposed
to us. The omens are good. Run therefore and get all ready
beneath the tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Punna answered obediently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, lady,” and ran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when she came to the tree, the Bodhisattva—the
Buddha-to-be—sat beneath it, and it appeared to her that his
body shone like light and she flushed and trembled with terror,
saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good indeed are the omens, for this is the Tree-Spirit himself
come to receive our offering!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with all her might she ran to tell this to her lady, and
when Sujata heard it she cried out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From this day be to me as a daughter, for this great good
news!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And running to where she kept her jewels she put upon the
happy Punna all those ornaments suitable to a daughter of the
house. And she thought; “What more can I do? For this
is a great day,” and so took up a precious golden dish and into
this she poured the milk-rice, and it rolled in like drops of
water slipping off a lily-leaf and filled the vessel, neither more
nor less. Then, covering it with a golden cover, she adorned
herself with her best jewels and went stately to worship and
make her offering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she came along the banks of the river, glad in the dawn,
robed in grey like a cloud before sunrise, and about her slender
wrists were bracelets of white chalcedony and the grey and
white of them resembled the colours of the rounded river-bubble
before it breaks, and she came as softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And parting the boughs she saw the Prince, his head fallen
back against the tree, eyes closed and helpless hands beside
him, and deep pity and veneration stirred in her heart, and
seeing it was no Tree-Spirit but a holy man she thought “May
he accept it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And bowing repeatedly she raised the dish in both hands,
entreating his greatness and thus offered it humbly, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, accept my gift and go where it seems good to you.”
And he, seeing in this the accomplishment of his purpose, received
it, and partook of that pure food while the happy giver
watched with such delight as when a mother feeds her only
child and beholds new life flow through his veins, and the
very air about the Prince appeared to distil in dews of visible
blessing upon her head and joy hitherto unknown possessed
her noble soul. And she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, may your wishes prosper as mine have done!”, and so
departed, caring no more for her golden dish than as if it had
been an autumn leaf upon the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the five ascetics, watching far off with greedy eyes, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ascetic Gotama has failed. He is now mere man.
Like the common herd he eats and drinks. He has nothing
to teach us—nothing! Mistaken indeed were we in thinking
to learn from a mere backslider! It is done and over, and the
Gods are angry with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they turned their backs in scorn and departed to Benares,
there to resume their austerities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Sujata was gone, timidly receiving thanks, the
Future Buddha arose and stood beneath the tree, refreshed in
heart and body, his face shining with renewed strength, his
energy swelling like a river in spate rushing rejoicing to the
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he knew that that place where for six years he had pursued
a vanishing truth could hold him no more, its use being
ended, and he set steadfast steps toward the tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O Tree of Wisdom, Tree of Knowledge unsearchable, Tree
whereunder the world’s deliverance was attained,—through all
the rain of years between our sight and thee, shall we not look
back and behold and veil our faces? For beneath this Tree
was Wisdom perfected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then taking his way, Bodhisattva begged from a man cutting
grass for his cattle, an armful of pure and pliant grass,
and, going onward, he saw before him that Tree of Knowledge,
broad-leaved, noble, a tower of leafage, and knowing that
this was where time and place meeting clasped hands, he spread
the grass and seated himself with folded hands and feet beneath
the pillared stems and the night came quietly down the
woodland ways and veiled him from the sight of man.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet of what follows I veil my face in writing, for
it is high, holy, and beyond the mind of man to conceive,
nor can it be told but in great parables, for by pictures
we teach little children. It is the Arhats only,—the perfected
saints,—who comprehend and can distinguish the symbol from
the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bodhisattva was tempted in the wilderness. Against him
that Wicked One led his hosts, strong and cunning to daunt
and allure. And as our Lord sat there in peace, suddenly the
calm sea, heaven-reflecting, of his mind, was tossed and torn
into wild billows as in a furious storm, and foes which he had
thought conquered, rose mighty against him, some most infinitely
sweet, piercing the heart with a pain more to be desired
than joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For, shaping on the dark like a picture—but real, so real
that he had but to rise and enter, came the lost heaven of
Kapila, where Rohini flowed in liquid light, and there in cool
green shades he beheld those loveliest in whose arms once he
lay. Soft bosoms, intolerably sweet after long pain and loneliness,
entreated him to rest. Deep eyes, love-filled, invited.
And at the last one alone drew near him and it seemed that
in that one fair face was centred all beauty that was his in those
far days. In one all wooed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to me—Come to me. Dear lord, you have borne
torture for long years and grief exceeding. You have hungered
and thirsted and wept tears of blood and still the Way eludes
you, and all was vain. There is no Way. It is delusion.
Vain it must be: not thus is Paradise found. Love is heaven—there
is no other.”—So said the Beautiful kneeling before
him, most dear and desirable, with passionate dark eyes more
eloquent than music plucked on harp or sitar, words spoken
between kisses and the slackening and straining of arms that
are the bonds of love. On his knees he felt the warmth of her
golden bosom, sun-kissed fruit for the tasting, on his hands
the clasp of those little fingers that once clenched his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put away your pale dreams of Heaven. O Prince beloved!”
she pleaded. “Heaven is here and now by bright
Rohini. Come, taking and giving joy. O sad and wearied,
and utterly foredone, come back to us and be made whole and
glad. Am I not yours? Rest in my arms. Forget the cold
ascetic, and be again our Prince, our warrior. Come! Time
goes swiftly and the sands of life are blown about the desert
and man knows them no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved as if to draw him with her, and all her naked
loveliness swam rose and gold before his eyes, long hair,
brightening at the tendril-ends, caressing the slender curves of
perfect feet, the smile of victory touching soft lips,—breathless
beauty waiting its fruition, queen and slave of men, thinking
its victory won, looking downward half amazed at its own
perfection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then lifting her head that Beautiful regarded him in triumph
as the moon rides serene over tossing waves, and lo! he sat
motionless and unmoved, with eyes looking past her to a distant
hope, and his face was set and calm as doom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly, shuddering together with the sighing shudder
of leaves in cold rain, the sweet shape wavered, trembled like
an image in water when the rings widen outward and all is
dispersed, and it was gone, for the waste night closed about it
and took it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the garden remained—that home beloved, and a new
and dearer shape wandered lonely by the river bank gazing
steadfastly upward to the bright billows of the silver peaks,
remote and pure as they, and she led by the hand a child.
And surely he whom lust cannot conquer may unashamed
kneel at the feet of love pure as the very sources of light!
And his heart said “My Princess!” and almost ceased to beat,
so strange, so sweet, that living bleeding memory;—and
whether it was the voice of his own soul or hers he could not
know,—but she seemed to shape the one word, “Beloved”, and
so withdrawing her gaze from the mountains, looked at him, all
love, all entreaty in those sunken eyes—beauty faded by grief,
but stronger a thousandfold to plead with him, and mutely she
showed the child, and so stood, waiting to know his sentence
whether she must live or die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And round her like mourning shadows swept the image of
his father, aged by grief and visibly stooping under the heavy
burden; the gentle queen, sister of his mother, who had fed
him from her own bosom, wrung her hands beside him and
all the faithful friends and servants who had guarded his
youth; and together they were the very voice of home, and his
own heart asked itself, “Have I the right to hurt these faithful
ones! But what are they and myriads like them to her—my
wife, my son!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And whether he would have moved to reach her, I cannot
tell, but suddenly, past all knowledge, he certainly knew that
never could that great lady his wife present herself as an obstacle
and a temptation, and that this was but a shift and a
shape-changer not to be trusted, dangerous and cunning like
the first, and steadfastly he gazed past her, his face set and
calm as doom, and shrieking horribly she fled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, thick as rain in <span class='it'>Wasa</span>, fell delirious dreams and
delusions, and there came about him frightful things, misshapen,
goblin, the very spume and smoke of the pit, and there
was a noise in the air, that stupified the brain, of shrieks and
shouts and groans and terrible cries and far off wailings and
it appeared as though great spirits fought in the air about
him with the black armies of the Wicked One.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And upon the night the Tempter flung a vast phantasmagoria
of the power and splendour awaiting the Prince if he would
but stoop to grasp them. King of the earth, throned and
crowned, he saw himself. And flames shot about the pictures
and huge confusions, and an ocean of terrors broke against
him, and the billows threatened to overwhelm him, and he knew
that did he relax but for the instant that a man blinks his eye,
all were lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he sat motionless his face fixed and calm as doom, and
it is told that in all the tumult not one leaf of the Tree flickered
but hung still as if carved in stone. Within its shadow
was calm: without tumult as when heaven and earth break
together in storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the strife raged about him and Lust and Love, and
Power and Wealth thundered or pleaded at his ear and could
not move him. And huge elemental Powers led on their armies,
deep instincts from the abyss of the primeval life of man, conqueering,
cunning, rock-rooted, hard to be fought, beckoning,
alluring, threatening. And some, robed like heavenly spirits,
showed, as it were, the Way, but it was no way, and very terrible
were the confusions, sights and sounds of that night of
dread. Nor is it possible or lawful that all should be uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the worst and utmost were done and endured and
no more remained, the Wicked One and his hosts, outwearied,
ceased their torment, and very slowly the angry roar of the
billows subsided and the foam of their fury stilled, and the
mind of the Blessed One relaxed into peace, and the great
darkness thinned as at the cold breath of dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon and the stars reappearing shed dying light, the
barriers of the dark being removed. And now—the marvel,—the
marvel!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let the Three Worlds wait in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the east became grey, and all being now hushed, our
Lord passed into deep and subtle contemplation and entered
thus upon the First Stage of Ecstasy, and this was the First
Watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, consciousness withdrawn into the Infinite, passing
through the bounds of human comprehension, seeing the world
as it truly is, not as it appears, his mind moved swiftly onward
and upward as the eagle soars effortless to the sun, or
rather, as the swimmer daring the current, is caught up and
carried strongly and without volition to his desired end. For,
be it known, this world about us is far other than it appears,
and with enlightenment we pass free from the fetters of illusion.
And this is Perception in which time as it is known in this our
world ceases to exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in this Perception he beheld his past lives and all his
former births, with their gains and losses, their sins and purities,
as they passed steadily onward and led him inevitably
to the Tree; seeing all at once as a picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And soaring higher, carried ever more swiftly onward, ever
more profoundly withdrawn, in the second watch he beheld with
diamond-clear perception all that lives, and the round of birth
and death of all mankind, hollow all and false and transient,
built upon nothingness—the piers and fabric of a dream; and
saw before him erring creatures born and born again to die,
the righteous and the evil heirs alike of pain self-inflicted,
and stabbed with daggers their own hands have forged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he saw the transient heavens gained through desire, won
through righteousness that craves reward, and beheld these
longer-lived than the joys of earth yet transient also, for he
who desires the joys of an individual heaven and pays down
righteousness as the coin of its price, he too is still held within
the pitiless fetters of craving, though it be for heaven, and
nothing rooted in desire is eternal, but must pass and be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he saw the hells that, gorged with suffering, yet again
yield up their prey to the weary round of rebirth and lo—heaven
and hell and earth empty and vain, the Wheel of Birth
and Death revolving evermore, hopeless and without delay
or stay, now heaven-high, now low as earth, but ever and ever a
whirling Wheel without rest. And in the third watch there
came Perception higher still and our Lord entered upon the
deep apprehension of Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in this the secrets of birth and death were apparent and
he became assured that age and death have their source in birth
and are rooted in it as trees in the ground, for the body and
earthly self implicate man in all evils, divided thus from the
Source, and, in a word, life in this world of ignorance, is suffering.
For here men walk blinded with ignorance, not knowing
whence nor whither, and the high things move veiled about
them and are not seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as to rebirth, he saw that its cause is in deeds done and
thoughts thought in former lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swept on and up in ecstasy, perception becoming ever clearer,
he beheld the so-called soul-self of man unravelled into its
component parts and laid before him like the unwoven threads
of a garment, and behold in these was no durability nor immortality,
for there is but one Immortal, one Infinite, and the
man who claims his own, his separate immortality, is dying and
reborn through the ages and but the fierce desire of life gives
him its simulacrum and the long-linked chain of births and
deaths and griefs immeasurable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So then, swept on and up in ecstasy, he beheld the causes of
the long-linked chain of existence stretching from Infinite to
Infinite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And these are they, and this is the lineage of suffering:</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Desire produces the clinging to shows and illusions.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Deeds engender birth.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Birth produces age and death.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this is the weary round, the offspring of Ignorance repeated
in the endless turning of the Wheel, the dragging of
a lengthening chain of births. For the ignorant man, desiring
the things that are worthless, transient, illusory, seeing about
him false shows instead of the high things which are real,
creates in himself a passion which in turn creates more and
more dangerous illusions, and thus is his own victim. But
when false desire dies, illusions end, and Ignorance, dispersing
like the night, gives place to the Sun of Enlightenment and
the world lies about such a man as it truly is. And he <span class='it'>knows</span>,
being no more the prisoner of time and space and their brood
of follies, for Ignorance, the true cause of all ill, in him is
dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And having thus perceived the world as it is, our Lord was
perfected in wisdom, and shows and illusions being ended for
him, there died in him that false self which will have all for
its own; never again to be born, utterly at an end,—even that
false ego shut in the prison of itself. And in him was completed
the destruction of craving and evil desire, as a fire
goes out for lack of fuel. For the man in whom is no separation
from the Source, in whom is no ignorance, how shall he
desire that which has no eternity but is transient as a morning
dream? And over him Desire and Death—which indeed are
one—had no more dominion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus first he found the way of perfect knowledge, and in the
broad east the onrushing of the sun’s golden wheels was heard
afar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he reached at last the unfathomable source of Truth, beholding
past, present, and future as one, having passed beyond
the glimmer of the six senses into true perception, no longer
gazing through a narrow window, but about and around him
the wide horizon—and more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Illumined with all wisdom sat the Buddha, the Perfected One,
having at last attained, and the light strengthened and grew
in rapture. And about him the world lay calm and bright and
a soft breeze lifted the leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And for seven days and nights sat our Lord beneath the Tree,
lost in contemplation of the World as it Is, submerged in the
ocean of love, having entered the Nirvana, most utterly at
peace, and day and night—or what men call such—made their
solemn procession about him unheeded, for he was lost in bliss,
and his heart said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, resting here, have I attained my birth-weary heart’s
desire, having traversed many lives to this goal. Now have
I slain the self, and the fetters are broken, and not for myself
alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And lifting up his voice he cried aloud this song of triumph
in the hearing of all worlds.</p>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f3'><a href='#r3'>[3]</a></span>

For this verse I have used Edwin Arnold’s translation slightly modified.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>For now he knew that the builder of the prison, the cause
of rebirth, the hinderer from the Peace was his own false self,
the dreamer of dreams, the creator of false desires and illusions,
and in him this false self was dead, and only the true, the Self
that is mysterious and high and One with the One survived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And next, sending his sight through the invisible (for when
enlightenment is attained all bars of time and space fall and
man is no longer blinded by his eyes and deafened by his ears),
he considered all that live, and like a swelling tide there rose
in him compassion for their darkness and misery, and in deep
contemplation he considered how to gain deliverance for them
also, and with this came the thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I teach? And how?” for he doubted that any would
believe and relinquish that false and illusory self which holds
men from the light. And he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can they believe the world is other than it seems
and the very sea and sky and mountains far differing from what
they have supposed? And they the prisoners of Ignorance.”
And a deep voice from the Divine within and without him
answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O let your heart most loving be moved into pity toward
the people, most ignorant, toiling amid deathly illusions to a
goal unknown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as this purpose rooted and flowered within him—a
mighty blossom opening its chalice of perfume to all worlds
and heavens, the dawn of the seventh day broke resplendent,
as it were a new heaven and a new earth and it was light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Light also within him and a great flooding of light, for not
only was the Way opened but the steps now lay clear before
him—the Noble Eightfold Path whereby men setting one foot
before the other achieve the first heights, the true Self developing
as does the body from lowly beginnings to great ends and
royalties, but all in order and gradually, each step rising by
the stepping stones of dead selves in dead lives to higher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O peace: O bliss inexplicable, not to be confounded with
others, but singular, lovely, and alone! Not in the heavens,
unattainable save by the strength of Gods, but within reach
of all who set their faces to the heights in true and steadfast
endeavour, proceeding step by step in love and patience. For
the lowly, the little children of the Law, as for the wise and
noble. For he who is ruler over a few things in this life shall
in lives to come be ruler over many, so he be found faithful.
And at the last—not the dewdrop lost in the ocean, but the
ocean drawn into the dewdrop and eternal Unity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in his heart this thought arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will proclaim accordingly the way unto the further shore!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he saw it, so he told it: He the stainless, the Very
Wise, the Passionless, the Desireless Lord; for what reason
should he speak falsely?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, flooded with sunshine and bathed in peace sat the
Perfect One.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>N</span><span class='sc'>ow</span> as the Blessed One sat beneath the Tree in the
Dawn, two merchants bound on their way passed
through the wood, and within them spoke the Voice
of Wisdom, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this wood, outspread upon the spurs of the mountain,
dwells a Rishi—a wise ascetic—deeply to be reverenced; go
then and make him an offering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with joy they went, glad in the opportunity of righteousness,
and found him enthroned beneath the Tree, laving his
feet in the ripples of the Sea of Bliss; and with reverence they
placed food in his bowl, a simple gift and good; and they were
respectfully silent while he ate, but when they saw that the
Exalted One, his need over, had washed his bowl and hands
in the mountain stream, they bowed their heads to his feet,
saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We who are here take refuge in the Perfect One and his
Law. May the Blessed One accept us as his adherents from
this day forth throughout our life, who have taken refuge in
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they were accepted as lay followers and went on their
business rejoicing in peace; and these were the first persons
who accepted the Law, with faith in the One Enlighted and his
teaching, for as yet the communion of the Order was not. And
their names were Bhallika and Tapussa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, having risen, he paused, and again seated himself in
meditation, for he doubted again whether it were either wise or
possible to make known the great Law to the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And into the mind of the Exalted One yet retired in solitude,
came this thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have penetrated this deep truth of the abandonment of
the imprisoning self, hard to be perceived, difficult to grasp.
Man moves in an earthly sphere, and there has he his place
and delights, tapestried about with illusions real indeed to the
dim feelers of his poor senses. For such it will be hard to
grasp this matter, the chain of causes and effects, for man
sees the effect but not the cause. And hard indeed to grasp
are withdrawal from earthly illusions, extinction of desire, cessation
of longing, and the deep mysterious Peace. Should I
now preach the Law, it would gain nothing—grief and weariness
would be the only fruit of labour. The truth remains
hidden from men absorbed by hate and greed. It is deep and
difficult, veiled from the coarse mind. How shall he apprehend
it whose thought moves in the darkness of earthly preoccupations?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was without doubt the last, the uttermost temptation
of that Wicked One, and the subtlety of it stirred a vibration
in the highest of the Divine Beings, and this thought arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly the world is lost, truly the world is undone if the
heart of the Perfect One be set on abiding in peace without
revealing the Law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And instantly this Divine thought was light in the heart of
the Exalted One and its symbol was that he beheld a Divine
Being who raised his folded hands before him, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it please the Perfect One to preach the Law! There
are a few whose eyes are not dimmed with the dust of earth.
They will see. They will hear. Open, O Wise One, the door
of Eternity. He who stands on the mountain peaks looks out
over all peoples. Go forth to Victory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, hearing this voice in his ears, the Exalted One turned
the gaze of perfect enlightenment upon the world, and he beheld
this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>As on a lotus stem bearing the lotus blossom of ivory,
some flowers do not rise out of the water but are below the surface,
and others float on the calm surface, and others rise
high, reflecting themselves in its mirror, so are men—some
pure, and some impure, some noble and some ignoble, some
strong in mind and intellect, others weak and dull,—but all
needing what they are qualified to take of the light of wisdom.
And perceiving this, he replied as it were to the Divine Voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was because I believed the toil fruitless, Holy One, that
I have not yet uttered the Word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Divine Voice perceived what would be, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is done. The Perfect One will preach the Law,” and the
matter being thus ended the Divine Voice returned to its source
and the Buddha passed onward in majesty, musing on the
first means whereby the Law should be made known. And
since a man owes deep duty to his teachers who, if they have
not opened the gate have yet directed him in the Path, his
though hovered first over Alara and Uddaka the Brahmans,—but
the diamond-clear inward sight revealed to him that in
the six years of his asceticism they were dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And next he remembered the five ascetics who had scorned
him when in starving he had tasted of the food offered by the
lady Sujata, thinking “These shall be the first fish I catch in
my net!”—and because they had betaken themselves to
Benares, he resolved that leaving the Forest of Enlightenment
he would go to that great and ancient city bathing her feet in
holy Ganges and there for the first time make known the
Pearl he had found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, alone in the wood, he arose from beneath the Tree and
turning regarded it steadfastly, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Tree, because of this, many generations of men as yet
unmanifested on earth, shall hold your name in honour and
a leaf of you shall be precious. Rejoice therefore and accept
the sunshine and rain gladly, knowing that life is in the least
of your leaves for ever and ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then with eyes deep and kind, shedding light, as it were
about him, steadfast in noble composure did he advance
through the Wood of Wisdom, taking the way to Benares,
strengthened as one fed on food divine. And beside the way
to Benares, journeying on in peace, he met a young and haughty
Brahman, proud in the possession of his greatness, whose name
was Upaka, and as this man went he repeated the mystic word
“Aum,” of which the three letters are the Threefold and the
word the One, and in this he put his faith. And seeing the
Exalted One passing by, rapt in meditation, he cried aloud
with scorn:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, Master,—what constitutes the true Brahman?” hoping
to trip him in his answer. And from the heart of his calm
the Exalted One replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To put away all evil, to be pure in thought, word and deed,
to transcend pride and desire,—this it is to be a true Brahman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the answer astonished the proud young man, and turning
suddenly he looked into the face of the Perfect One and
said slowly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How comes it that your face is so beautiful, shining like
the full moon reflected in water, your form so stately? And
whence the peace that surrounds you? What is your noble
tribe, and who your master? Here, in this country, where each
man struggles to find the Way, what is your way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, glad at heart, the Perfect One answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy the solitude of him who is full of joy, who has seen
the truth. Happy he who in all the wide world has no ill-will,
self-restrained and guided, Happy—happiest is freedom
from lusts and desires. And highest is the bliss of freedom
from the pride of the thought <span class='it'>I am I</span>. No honourable tribe
have I,—no Teacher. I go alone and content.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Brahman heard in great astonishment, for much as
he had heard of religion it was not this. And he said,
hesitating:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where, sir, are you bound?” And the World-Honoured
replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I desire to set revolving the Wheel of the Excellent Law,
and therefore I go to the great and ancient city of Benares,
to give light to them that sit in darkness and to open the gate
of true Immortality to men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the Brahman Upaka heard this his pride was
revolted and he was angry that a man should assume to himself
such mastership, and he replied curtly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reverend person, your way lies onward,” and struck into
the opposite path, yet as he went, he stopped, proceeded,
stopped again, lost in thought, for there was that in the occurrence
which startled him from his equanimity. So the
moment goes by us, and we do not know it! But the Blessed
One, proceeding quietly day by day, came at last to Benares,
to the Deer Park of Isipatana where now dwelt the five
ascetics who had scorned him. And there they sat practising
the weary round of their austerities, not knowing that the
Perfect One who approached them had discovered the way
that leads from the world of sorrowful becoming and the
flowing stream of transiency into the world of happy being
where all is beheld as it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For to the man who knows not the way all things flow and
pass in unreality and nothing abides; but the foot of him who
has thus attained is set on the Eternal and in That is no motion
nor any change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when they saw him coming the five ascetics were angry,
and they said to one another:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friends, here comes the ascetic Gotama [using in contempt
his family name] he who eats rich food, who lives in self-indulgence
and has given up his quest. Let us show him no
respect nor rise up to meet him, nor take his alms-bowl nor
cloak from him. Let us only give him a seat as we would to
any person, and he can sit down if he likes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the nearer the Exalted One came to the five the more
did the majesty of his presence precede him, and the less
could they abide by their resolution. Slowly they rose, and
went forward, and one took the cloak and alms-bowl—another
brought a seat, a third brought water, and accepting the
water the Blessed One sat down and bathed his weary feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then they addressed him as “Friend” and “Gotama” but
he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not seemly, monks, that you should address Him who
has thus Attained as ‘Friend’ and ‘Gotama.’ For I am now
the Enlightened. Open your ears: I teach you the Law. If
you will learn, the Truth shall meet you face to face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, still in much doubt, they said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you were not able, friend Gotama, to attain full knowledge
by mortification of the body, is it likely you can attain
it by self-indulgence and a worldly life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus replied the Blessed One:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monks, I do not live in self-indulgence although I torture
my body no more. Nor have I forsaken my quest. Open
your ears. Found is deliverance from death and illusion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And because the five still doubted, the Blessed One said
to them:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, monks,—when we dwelt in the forest, did I ever
before speak to you in this manner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it is told in the ancient scriptures that the very Evening
opened their ears and heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, with the five about him, the Perfect One spoke the
first words of the Teaching of the Law, the first ever heard
in this world,—and where the last shall be spoken who can
tell? But it is needful that all to whom their happy Karma
allows it should hear and ponder these words for in them is
all truth. Now this is the high teaching in the Deer Park of
Isipatana, as dusk came on and the shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it is told in the ancient scriptures that the very evening
appeared to bow at the knees of the Exalted One—the World-Honoured,
that she might hear his word. Like a maiden she
came, the stars the pearls about her throat, the gathering dark
her braided hair, the deepening vastness of space her cloudy
robe. For a crown had she the holy heavens where dwell
divine spirits. The Three Worlds were her body, her eyes
were as blue lotus blossoms opening to the moonlight, and her
voice of stillness as the distant murmur of bees. To worship
and to hear the Perfect One this lovely maiden came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And though our Lord spoke in the Pali tongue each man
heard his own. And thus said the Blessed One, the Tathagata,
He who has thus Attained:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monks, there are two extremes which he who would follow
my attainment must shun. The one is a life of pleasure devoted
to desire and enjoyments. That is base, ignoble, unworthy,
unreal, and is the Path of Destruction. The other
is the life of self-mortification and torture. It is gloomy,
unworthy, unreal. It is nothing and leads to nothing. But
hear and be attentive, monks, for I have found the Middle
Way which lies between these two, the way which in a spiral
of eight stages ascends the Mount of Vision even to the summit
where dwells the glory of the Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the Noble Eightfold Path, and the stages in their
order. Right Comprehension. Doubts and wrong views and
mere opinions must be laid aside. The man must perceive
the distinction between the Permanent and the Transient.
He must behold facts behind hypotheses. Realization of the
need of truth is the attitude for its reception. This is the
first stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right Resolution. This is the will to attain, based on self-discipline
and the vision which has perceived that attainment
of perfect knowledge is possible. This is the second stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right Speech. This is the first step in the practice of self-discipline.
Indiscretion, slander, abuse, and bitter words are
forbidden. Only such words must be uttered as are kind,
pure, true. This is the third stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right Conduct. Deeds which are blameless, true, and noble.
These only must be done. Put away all thought of gain or
reward here or hereafter, for the motive is the deed. Retaliation
is dead. Impulse cannot exist with discipline. Deeds
actuated by likes and dislikes are forbidden,—let each action
be guided by inward Law irrespective of whom it concerns.
Act only from this Law which is in its highest Love and Pity,
and very swiftly will come the insight to distinguish which
deeds are in harmony with the Law and which gainsay it,—and
that blessedness will follow which the doer has not thirsted
to gain or garner. This is the fourth stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very difficult to climb are the two stages of Right Speech
and Right Conduct, but, when they are surmounted, fair and
wide and noble is the prospect seen from those heights, and
very great self-mastery is gained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right Living. And this includes the right means of earning
a livelihood for there are means a man cannot follow and
maintain his integrity and purity. Let him take heed to avoid
these dangerous circumstances, and which they may be that
man’s mind shall declare to him if he have trodden the Four
First Stages. Such a man cannot be in doubt. And so is
the learner become a Master. This is the Fifth stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right Effort. Now, loving, wise, and enlightened, he apportions
all his strength to wise purpose, fully comprehending
his deed and its aim. He who has reached this noble stage
does all, whether eating or drinking, sleeping or waking, working
or resting, in harmony with the great Law, for in his
obedience he is perfect, and the Law is his life, nor does he
need to consider longer than while a man in health need count
his heart-beat. And this is the Sixth Stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right Meditation. This is the right state of a mind at peace,
self, he considers only the truth, and having utterly abandoned
the thought of self he is clear in perception, having slain
illusion and stood face to face with Reality as a man speaks
with a friend. He is the Knower of Truth. More, he <span class='it'>is</span> the
Truth, and this is the Seventh Stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right Meditation. This the right state of a mind at peace.
At peace indeed, for what is left for grief? Nothing is here
to wail, nothing but what must quiet us. Doubt and fear,
trouble and confusions are dead. Groundless beliefs, false
hopes and fears are forgotten, and in this stage is the attainment
of the Peace which passes understanding. This is the
Eighth Stage from which, having attained, a man cannot fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, monks, you may ask, what is the cause from which
springs the need for the Noble Eightfold Path? It is this.
Hear the Four Noble Truths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Birth is the cause of suffering, for life is suffering, passing
through all the stages of grief from birth to death. This is
the first Truth. The cause of birth is the thirst for living,
leading from birth to birth, fed by the lust of the flesh, the lust
of the eye, the pride of life. This is the second Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cure of the cause of birth is the extinction of this
thirst for living by complete extinction of wrong desire, letting
it go, expelling it, giving it no room. This is the third Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the fourth Truth is the Noble Eightfold Path. These
are the four Truths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So by the truth of suffering, monks, my eyes were opened to
these conceptions and judgment and vision were opened in me.
Not by sacrifice nor mortification nor prayer, but by that
which a man has in himself is the Way of Deliverance opened.
And as long as I did not know this I had not received enlightenment.
But now have I attained, and deliverance is secured,
and henceforth I shall no more go out into birth and death.
Death has no more dominion over me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the first Teaching and it was spoken in the Deer Park
at Isipatana,—and the five ascetics sat about to hear,
and borne on these great words, their eyes were opened and
with joy they accepted the Law, and the chief of them, Kondanna,
since called “Kondanna the Knower,” entreated the
Lord that he would receive them as disciples, and in these
words he received them:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Draw near, monks, well preached is the Doctrine. Walk
in purity to the goal of the end of all suffering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And further he taught them of the transiency and impermanence
of all earthly things and of the Truth that lies beyond
when the world is apprehended as it is, free of illusion, free
of the fleeting apprehensions of the senses, and knowing this,
they entered into the Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when it was ended the darkness was deep about them
and the night of rest was come.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='pt3'>PART III</h1></div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>S</span><span class='sc'>o</span> for a time the World-Honoured dwelt in the Deer
Park of Isipatana, and men came eagerly to hear him,
for his teachings resembled none they had heard as
yet and delivered them from the yoke of priests in teachings
and beliefs which if they could not inwardly accept made them
very sorely afraid of the anger of the Gods and compelled
much ceremonial and expiation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But He, who has thus Attained, the Tathagata, taught them
thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No priest, no God, can deliver a man. By himself is evil
done, by himself he endures the shame and pain. By himself
and his own will and struggle he becomes pure. There is none
can save a man but himself—No, none in heaven or earth.
It is he himself who must walk the Way: The Enlightened
can but show it. Therefore where and how can a priest aid
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this appeared to them a most wonderful doctrine, inspiring
with great courage and resolution, and looking upon
each other they said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it be thus, and a man holds deliverance in the hollow
of his hand, it can be done. To-day, brother, let us take the
first step.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the Exalted One taught them to break the fetter
of the delusion of self—the delusive belief that the individual
self is real and self-existent. For to abide contented in the
prison of this apparent self not looking forward to its expansion
into the Universal self is the shadow of egoism and
egoism is the mother of sin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he broke off them the fetter of the belief that outward
righteousness of conduct will deliver a man, or that safety
lies in rites and ceremonies, for truly a man can never say
within himself, “I have placated the Gods and may now go
my way in peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now at this time there was in the great city of Benares, a
noble youth named Yasas, son of a rich man, master of one of
the city guilds, and on this son his parents had lavished every
good thing. He possessed a house of cool shades for summer,
and another for the season of the rains. And his houses were
full of delicately beautiful dancing girls, jewelled and perfumed,
and what pleasure was absent, whether of food or
wines, or music or any other?—None indeed, for the rich merchants
dwell in luxury resembling that of kings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at first all this was good to him and he asked no more;
but fulfilled every desire on the instant. There are men so
embruted that this will content them until bodily power fails,
but the noble youth Yasas was not of these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly in the midst of his pleasures deep loathing
fell upon him and secret disgust because he had sounded the
utmost of pleasure and no more or better remained, and it
was like vomit in his mouth, revolting to his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And one night as he lay among his women, and they, abandoned
to sleep, surrounded him, lovely as maidens of Mount
Sumeru, he leaned against his silken cushions and the hall
became hateful to him and he could no more endure it, but rose
softly and put on his gilded shoes and went out into the midnight
gardens where dripping dew impearled every leaf and
blossom and glittered in pure moonlight, and the cool and
calm were excellent. And he walked under the black and
white light and dark of a long path by trees whose carven
leaves hung like sculptured stone in the stillness of the air
and their shadows flitted like dreams over his robes and face
as he went, meditating upon the unspeakable weariness and
distaste that filled him and the uncomforted wretchedness of
youth that in all the world can find no good. And he said
aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O my heart, how oppressive it is! O, my soul, the speechless
weariness! Who in all the world shall show me any
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, in his walking, he came to the gate of the garden and
it stood wide open and the porter lay drowned in sleep, his
face hidden from the moonlight, and there was none to see
who came or went, and Yasas wandered on through dewy ways
and silver pools of moonlight, not knowing where he went,
having fled the house because he could no longer endure his
despair. And as he came at last to the Deer Park of Isipatana
the darkness began to thin for dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was that the Lord had risen from sleep and
walked beneath the trees of Isipatana in meditation and he
saw a young man coming, and in the great stillness heard him
say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O my grief, how deep is my wretchedness,” and he pitied
him, for he himself had been a rich young man, and he knew
his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, taking his seat, the Blessed One said aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, you are weary, but I hold in my hand a life that is
neither grievous nor wretched. Sit down beside me and hear
the Law. This doctrine, Yasas, is not oppressive. This is
not afflicting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Yasas seeing beneath the trees a young man of royal
bearing and beauty like to but surpassing his own, yet robed
as a monk, was startled. Nor could he refuse, and he took
off his gilded shoes and having saluted the stranger with
courtesy sat down beside him, and in the quiet of the coming
dawn, the Blessed One spoke. And first he spoke of the
misery, worthlessness and ruin of lust, of the strong calm of
renunciation, of the high way of the Law, and as he heard, in
place of burning disgust there flowed into the heart of Yasas
the refreshing streams of wisdom, as when a man sets hot and
travel-worn feet in the coolness of a pellucid lake. And there
was that fruit of former births within the noble youth which
drew him to high things, even as a pure silken fabric is with
ease dyed a noble colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Lord saw this, and knowing his heart elate and
ready he then set before him the Four Noble Truths of Sorrow
and the Noble Eightfold Path, and the eyes of Yasas were
opened and conquering joy possessed him, and the sun rose
within and without him in splendour, and it was day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Yasas arose and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible that I should return to my former life for
I see it now unreal and foolish, a tale told by a madman
signifying nothing. Let me receive from the Lord ordination
and admission to the Order that I may spend eternity in acquiring
knowledge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Blessed One answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, monk. The Doctrine is well taught. Lead henceforward
a new life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he was received into the Order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And presently his father, the rich guild-master, came running,
eagerly asking whether the Exalted One had seen his son
pass that way. And thus he fell into talk with the Tathagata,
(even with Him who has thus Attained) and he too became
ensnared by that great Presence and great Doctrine as a bee
with perfumed mogra blossoms, for sweet, sweet is the Truth
to them who are akin to it; and last he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful, great sir, most wonderful! This truly is showing
the way to the lost and setting a lamp in darkness. I take
refuge in the Lord, the Law, and the Assembly. May the
Lord take me as a lay-disciple henceforth, while my life lasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he was accepted, and looked upon his son, now divested
of jewels and clad in the yellow robe with bared shoulder,
and the Exalted One said to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it possible, householder, that Yasas, the noble youth
should return to a worldly life of lusts and pleasure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, it is not possible. It is gain to Yasas the noble youth,
that his mind should be set free. Will the Exalted One consent
this day to take food with me, with Yasas beside him as
a younger brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Buddha by silence gave his consent. So were
these two freed from the bonds of desire and entered into the
Peace. For they knew the Truth, and this was their desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And of the light companions of Yasas, many, allured to the
teaching by his joy, heard and were glad and followed, and
many more, too many to tell, women as well as men (for
the Blessed One welcomed women also, regarding neither sex
nor caste) sought the Deer Park of Isipatana and followed the
Law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And these are the commandments they accepted, and be it
understood that the first five only are binding upon laymen
and women, but the whole ten are binding on the Brotherhood,

<p class='pindent'>And now, when sixty of the disciples had attained complete
enlightenment, it came into the mind of the Blessed One that
the time was come to send them forth into the world to spread
the high Doctrine, and he said to them:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See now!—You have passed the river and reached the shore
of peace, and for you birth and death are no more, being one
with the Unchanging. Go then through every country, teach
those who have not heard. Make known the Teaching, lovely
in its origin, its progress, and most lovely in its consummation.
Make it known both in the spirit and the letter, Go!—each
one travelling by himself (But later they went two together)
rescue and receive. I too will go—for the work is
begun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Yasas he would not send out into the world for his
aged parents had need of him in Benares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the sixty having in all reverence received his commands
went forth, for in those days books were not and
each man was a book of the Law, and the Lord himself went
on to Gayasisa, followed by many who had been ascetics.
And great joy went with them and a shining peace, for like a
swelling wave exaltation lifted their souls so that each looking
on the other was glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at Gayasisa that the Exalted One uttered the great
Fire teaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the cause of it was this. As he and his disciples sat
on the Elephant Rock near Gaya, with the wide and pleasant
valley of Rajagriha outspread beneath them, a jungle fire broke
out across the valley and they watched it, and thus spoke the
World-Honoured; drawing a lesson as they looked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything about and within us, brethren, is on fire, and
how? The senses are afire with passion, hate and illusion.
The mind with its perceptions and sensations is afire with
passion, hate and illusion, betrayed and deceived every way.
Every approach by which a man beholds and comes in contact
with life is afire with passion and illusion, and these all in turn
supply fuel to the burning. And the wise and noble disciple,
perceiving this, is indifferent to the lies of the senses and the
sensations arising from them whether pleasant or unpleasant.
He is indifferent to mental perceptions whether pleasant or unpleasant.
And this indifference extinguishes the fire and cools
its ashes and deprives it of fuel and thus frees him from passion
and illusion, and being free he recognizes his freedom. He
clings no more to the individual and selfish self. Rebirth is
destroyed, the life of pure duty and love is lived, and the world
has no more wherewith to tempt him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And many heard and accepted the teaching and found peace,
having seen that behind this false world of illusion created
by the senses lies the true world of things as they are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And from Gaya, the World-Honoured, followed by his disciples,
went onward to the city of Rajagriha, the chief town
of King Bimbisara, and with him went Kassapa, a great disciple,
and wise, who had been a worshipper of the pure element
of the sacrificial fire until he had heard the teaching of the
Buddha, and so great and wise was this man that many of
the people of Rajagriha doubted which was the Master and
which the disciple. But the Exalted One willing to honour
the disciple addressed him thus in presence of the King and
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welcome, great Master, welcome! Rightly have you distinguished
Law, winning the highest wisdom. And now, as a
wealthy noble displays his treasures to bring forgetfulness of
sorrow to those who love beauty, so do you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it is told that immediately Kassapa, composing himself
into ecstasy, was raised up in the air before the eyes of all
and this wonderful sight drew their eyes in adoration of so
mighty a marvel, so that with different mouths but in language
one they magnified the Buddha, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the World-Honoured be our teacher. We are his
disciples.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And perceiving them eager to hear, he addressed them on
the false self the lying, that is nothing but claims all within
and without as fuel for its greed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hear and be wise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mind, the thought and all the senses are subject to the
law of life and death, and, understanding the self and the
transient things of which it is compounded and how the thought
and senses act, there is no room left for this individual <span class='it'>I</span> nor
any ground for this <span class='it'>I</span>, for it is this belief in <span class='it'>I</span> which gives
rise to all sorrows binding us as with cords to the world of
illusion. But when a wise man knows there is no such <span class='it'>I</span> and
that it does not exist, the bonds are severed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of those who believe in this false <span class='it'>I</span>, some say it endures
beyond death some say it perishes. Grievous is the error of
both. For if they say this <span class='it'>I</span> is perishable, then all the fruit
of their striving perishes and there is no hereafter, and who
can call this deliverance?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if they say this greedy <span class='it'>I</span> is immortal, then in the midst
of all life and death in this world of illusion there is but one
identity that is not born and does not die—even this greedy
<span class='it'>I</span>. And if the one immortal thing is this greedy <span class='it'>I</span> which arrogates
all to itself then is it the one thing in the whole Universe
that is self-perfect, and there is no need of high and noble
deeds,—this greedy self is lord and master of all, and what
need to strive for what is already done? For if this greedy
<span class='it'>I</span> is lasting and imperishable then can it never be changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when a man has learned there is <span class='it'>no</span> greedy <span class='it'>I</span>, that it
does not exist, that it can do nothing, is but an illusion, then,
freed, he passes on to the wider outlook, the nobler knowledge,
and he passes on also in other lives the same yet not the same,
as the shoot springs from the seed, and the seed is not the
shoot, not one and yet not different. Such is the birth of all
that lives. Learn therefore that this <span class='it'>I</span> does not exist, and the
illusion of it conceals That which Is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the World-Honoured, the Happy One, great and glad,
addressed the King and people, and very joyfully they heard,
understanding that in the egoism of the <span class='it'>I</span> lives all curse, all
ignorance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the King became a lay follower and throughout his life
was faithful and many of the noble young men about him
believed also, and many of the people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was here too, in happy Rajagriha, that the Perfect One,
gained the two greatest of his Arhats, his perfected saints,
and thus it befell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a day to be remembered, it so chanced that Assaji, a
disciple, walked in the streets, collecting alms of food in his
bowl, and he walked in the shade, in the yellow robe, one
shoulder bare, composed and with majesty, musing as he went.
And he was thus observed by a young Brahman of noble birth
who was studying spiritual things in the city under a teacher,
and when he saw him the dignity of his serene presence moved
the heart of the Brahman Sariputta, and he thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely this is one who has already attained the way of
purity! I will go and ask him in whose name he has renounced
the world and by what Law. Not yet, for he is collecting alms,
but presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore he watched, and when the venerable Assaji had
received food from the householders he turned back, and Sariputta
approached him with a courteous salutation, which having
concluded, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend, your eyes are shining, your colour pure and clear.
Great is your composure. In whose name have you renounced
the world and who is your honourable Master?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend, my master is the Son of the Sakya House, the descendant
of Kings; I am but a novice. As yet I cannot tell the
great heights of the Law, but in a few words I can give its
spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be it so, friend. Instruct me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And musing a moment, Assaji said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Perfected One teaches how existences apparently
separate are dependent upon One Cause, how they depend upon
one another, their apparent separateness springing from ignorance
and illusion as its cause, and how these existences can be
ended and the Truth of Unity appear. This is the teaching
of the Son of the Sakyas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he heard these words, suddenly their implications
and how they affect all within and without us and the whole
Universe, flashed into the clear vision of Sariputta, and he understood
as a consequence:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever is subject to the law of beginning that also is
subject to the law of decay, and how should the <span class='it'>I</span> be excepted?
There is but one Unchanging, motionless and eternal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And deeply moved, he said to Assaji:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the teaching were nothing else but this you have at any
rate overpassed suffering. That which many ages have not
seen is revealed to us now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And leaving Assaji, who pursued his way in peace, Sariputta
hastened with winged feet to his friend and fellow-student
Moggalana, and Moggalana seeing him cried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your eyes are shining. Your colour is pure and clear.
Have you then found deliverance from death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have found it. I have found it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And standing there breathless he told him of Assaji and his
words, and on the great mind of Moggalana, strong in clear
perception, flashed also the truth of the nonentity of the
greedy <span class='it'>I</span>, and unable to delay, panting for the truth, they left
the ascetic who taught them, and hurried to the wood where
the Perfect One taught sitting among his disciples, and when
he saw the two young Brahmans approach full of eagerness
and awe, he said to those about him. “Welcome these two,
for they shall be my greatest—the one unsurpassed for wisdom,
the other for supernormal power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he himself welcomed them with joy, seeing that they
would stand about him as bright stars about the moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when they had told him their case and heard his words,
he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, monks, the Doctrine is well taught! Lead henceforward
the pure life for the extinction of suffering,” and thus
received them to be his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And shortly after this he founded the Sangha, the Brotherhood
formally, and drew up the first code for its governance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the number of his followers grew and increased mightily,
for not only the people but many of the noble youths of the
Kingdom of Maghada joined themselves to this most noble
young man, the Son of the Sakyas, so much so that some of the
people were angry and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ascetic Gotama is come to bring childlessness and
widowhood and the decay of families,” and they made a verse
that was repeated in the streets:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The great monk has come through the wood-ways:</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;he sits on the hill,</p>
<p class='line0'>And whom will he steal from us next,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;for he takes whom he will?”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And his disciples hearing this verse went to the Exalted One
and repeated it, dwelling on the anger of some of the people.
But the Perfect One smiled, for the young monks were angry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seven days will this excitement last, monks, and for that
time only. But if they taunt you with that verse, reply with
this:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The heroes, the Perfect Ones, lead by the Truth:—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;and who calls it amiss?</p>
<p class='line0'>If the Buddha persuades by the truth, will ye</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;blame him for this?”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And the disciples smiled also and were content, and in seven
days it was forgotten, and still the great and lowly flocked to
hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now of the people who flocked to him many desired signs
and wonders that so they might be convinced of the truth,
but these were not given in that manner and the Blessed One
forbade his disciples to exalt themselves thus. For there is
nothing but the taintless beauty of Law throughout the worlds,
and the wise know there is no miracle at all, but only a higher
law, not known to the ignorant, which in its action appears to
them strange and a miracle. Yet did our Lord teach that
for the instructed there are the powers, since to them in their
higher consciousness the bonds of time and space and form
exist no more. But it is useless and perilous to expose these
mysteries before the ignorant who can but see in them the
breaking of the law, and see it either with fear or greed.
Therefore he taught that those who have attained should be
wise and silent in knowledge where the occasion does not
demand speech or action, and very rarely can they be demanded,
for each stage has its own knowledge and cannot rise to the
knowledge of a consciousness above its own. Hence all this
foolish talk of miracle and the like. But for those who know
even in part the fetters are broken:—the binding fetters of
form, time and space. And of such a case the Lord told this
story, while he rested at one time at Jetavana:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a faithful, noble, joyful disciple who desired to
hear again the words of Him who has thus Attained, and he
came in the evening to the river Aciravati, hoping to cross
by the ferry. But so it was that the boatman had himself gone
to hear the great words and there was no ferry. Then, joyful
in meditating on the Light, and lost of all else, that
faithful disciple walked on the water of the river, and his
feet made no holes in the water, and he went as if on dry land.
But suddenly in the middle of the river he saw waves, and his
joy sank and his feet with it, for fear entered his soul and
fear is a fetter of the world of form, so that he immediately
became subject to it. But again he strengthened his inmost
self in meditation on the Enlightened One, and again he walked
on the water and so came to Jetavana and saluted the Blessed
One, and took his seat respectfully beside him, and the Lord
asked: ‘Disciple, did you come with little fatigue by the road?
Have you lacked for food?’ And he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, in my joyful meditation I received support so that
I walked on the water and did not sink, and thus have I come
to Jetavana as though I walked on dry land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Lord said: “So also has it been in past lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For he taught that though there are times and seasons for
the powers to be manifested to the ignorant, they are very
few.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>N</span><span class='sc'>ow</span> while the Perfect One dwelt by Rajagriha there
came to him a message from Kapila, from his father,
the Maharaja Suddhodana, and it said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son, tidings have reached me of great things concerning
you and the fulfilment of prophecies. But of these I will
not speak for it is fitting that I should hear them from your
own lips. But this I have to say: Is it not just and right
that I should see my son before I die? Come to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when this reached the Enlightened One it was impossible
that he should doubt or hesitate, for who had more right
to call upon him? And so, preparing himself for the journey
on foot with certain of his disciples, once more he set his face
to Kapila looking toward the mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And many things filled his heart, of memory and of affection,
but all now controlled and guided by divine knowledge and
certitude so that he went surrounded by peace and glad in that
he carried a great gift to his father exceeding all gold, all
jewels of all kings, if so it could be received, repaying thus
the tenderness which had guarded his youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the Maharaja and the people of Kapila heard
he would come, from that day forth they watched the ways to
the city that they might with due eagerness and joy welcome
the great return of their Prince. For they said proudly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our Prince who left us to seek enlightenment has now
found it, and gloriously returns!” and they thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To what kingdom has the like happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So journeying on foot, the Blessed One, crowned with the
Ten Perfections, at last approached Kapila, and those who
were the far outposts of the watch ran back to the next and
those to the next until it reached the city crying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Prince comes! The Prince comes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Maharaja having prepared himself, surrounded by
his lords and all the neighbouring nobility, went forth along
the flower-strewn ways (for the people hurried with flowers
and banners and perfumes) to meet the great guest. And the
heart of the Maharaja was hot within him and exulted,
thinking:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He returns and the clouds are past and the sun of his glory
drowns all in its brightness, and my good days are come again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they paused in the principal street of the town and there
waited in the shade, with banners and flowers making gay the
blue air about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then at long last moving through the streets, followed by
two others, the Maharaja and his nobles saw a young monk
clad in the yellow robe, with one shoulder bared, who in his
hands carried an alms-bowl, and at each house door stopped
and silently tendered the bowl, receiving with majesty what
was given, and passing on with patience when it was refused.
And it was his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then shame and love and anger contended in the heart of
the Maharaja and tore him like a whirlwind among the leaves
of a tree, and he clenched his robe across his breast and cried
out aloud to Siddhartha:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am put to shame—to horrible shame. My son a beggar!
Our race is beaten to the earth with shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And standing calmly before the angry Maharaja the Blessed
One after due salutation lifted his eyes and replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maharaj, this is the custom of our race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This horrible thing is not so. Not one of our ancestors has
ever begged his bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maharaj, you and your high race claim descent from kings,—but
my descent is far otherwise. It is from the Buddhas
of ancient days, and as they have done, begging their food from
the charitable, so do I, nor can I otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But seeing his father still in pain from anger and sorrow,
the Perfected One spoke thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I not know that the King’s heart bleeds with love and
memory, and that for his son’s sake he adds grief to grief?
But now let these earthly bonds of love be instantly unloosened
and utterly destroyed, for there are greater and higher. Ceasing
from thought of such love, let the King’s mind receive
from me such spiritual food as no son has yet offered to father,
a gift most beautiful and wonderful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So leading the King by the hand they went together to the
palace, the mind of the Maharaja quieted and subdued as after
a storm the billows sink to rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And within the palace the Perfected One looked for Another,
but she was not there, for her very life beat against her body
in agony, remembering, remembering, and she said in her
heart:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not go. I cannot go. If I am of any value in his
eyes, I, the mother of his son, he will come to me. I cannot
go to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, when a little time had passed, the Perfected One arose,
and attended by the two mightiest of his disciples and followed
by the Maharaja went to the Palace of his wife, and as he
went, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monks, if this lady should embrace me, do not hinder her,
though it be against the rule.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And pacing silently beside him, the two comprehended the
wisdom and compassion of the Lord, bowing their heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they entered the hall where the Princess stood unveiled,
the glory of her hair shorn, clad in a coarse robe of
yellow resembling his own, and divested of all jewels and
splendours, and she stood like the marble image of a woman as
he entered, pale in the shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, seeing him, suddenly love and manifold anguish broke
in a freshet in her heart as when the melting snows fill Rohini
until she floods her banks; and pride and love, each stabbed
to the heart, strove within her, and with piteous eyes she looked
upon her Lord once so near and now so far, as he stood calmly
regarding her with a look she could not understand, and love
had the victory, and she ran to him and falling on the ground
laid her face upon his feet and embraced them weeping most
bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was silence, none hindering or speaking, and he
looked down upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after awhile remembrance returned to her and his silence
and the distance wide as heaven and earth between them,
and she rose with majesty and withdrew herself to one side
and stood with bowed head while the Maharaja declared to the
Perfected One her griefs and patience and mortifications so
that she might resemble him, abjuring her bed for a mat laid
upon the ground, and the feasts of the palace for one poor
meal a day, and much more. And the Prince heard and speaking
slowly, still with his eyes upon her, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is true. Great also was the virtue of this high lady,
the mother of Rahula, virtue in a former life which I remember
and she too will remember one day with gladness. Lady,
mother of my son, the way that I have opened is open for you
also. Come and hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with his eyes upon her to the last he turned and went
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that evening, seated by the bank of Rohini, the Perfect
One taught the Way before his own people, and they crowded
to hear; and this high lady seated, veiled so that none might
see her hidden eyes, heard also, and as she listened, illusion
fell from her; she perceived the Unchanging, the Formless, the
Beautiful, and the illusory forms of this world and the delusion
of time fell from her also, and she beheld her love no longer
past and done with, but eternal as the eternity of the Self that
alone endures, and the imprisoning self which alone can suffer
died within her and left her enfranchised, and inward light
shone upon her and she knew the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So also was it with the Maharaja and the Maharani Prajapati
and many more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But on the next day the Princess Yashodara called to her son
Rahula and dressed him in his best until he shone bright and
beautiful as a star, and she laid her cheek against his, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go now, beloved, and seek your father and ask for your
inheritance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, I know of no father but the Maharaja. What father?
And why should he withhold my inheritance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she said: “Go and ask. But first see, that you may
know him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led the boy to the window and pointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That monk, clothed in the yellow robe, he whose face
shines like the sun in its strength, is your father. And he has
great wealth—riches, not to be told in words. Go, son, and
demand your inheritance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the boy went, wondering and desiring, and in the garden
he ran quickly and catching the robe of the Blessed One, he
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father, how happy I am to be near you. O day of
gladness,” and tears of joy overflowed his eyes, seeing his father
so great and beautiful. But to test him, the Blessed One was
silent, pacing toward the Nyagrodha grove, and still the child
followed, entreating for his inheritance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then when they reached the grove, the Perfected One turned
smiling to Sariputta the great disciple, and he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monk, what think you? For worldly wealth perishes, but
this remains. Shall I make my son heir to the Greatest? Let
us admit him to the Order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was done, and the heart of the Princess sang within
her for bliss, and henceforward the boy trod the way of Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So leaving joy and tranquillity behind him and measureless
content in the soul of Yashodara, the Blessed One returned to
Shravasti on the river Rapti and there a rich merchant, Anathapindika,
gave to the Order a pleasant grove named Jetavana,
and a monastery, and there during the rains our Lord
dwelt and many of his teachings and discourses were spoken at
Jetavana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was the manner of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Blessed One would rise early in the morning, and that
some one of his followers might gain merit he accepted service,
and water was brought to him for ablution, and having performed
this he would sit alone until it was time to go and beg
his food. Then he would put on his tunic, girdle, and robe,
and taking his bowl would enter the village or town for alms.
Sometimes alone, sometimes with other monks, many of them
men of great and noble birth. And it seemed that gentle
breezes cleared the air for him and clouds let fall rain to lay the
dust, and where he placed his foot the way was even and
pleasant and flowers blossomed. And it appeared to those
who saw, that rays of radiance surrounded his person, since
he possessed the attributes of that true world which encompasses
the illusions of the false world perceived by the senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By all these tokens and more did the people know who approached,
and they said to each other:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bhagavat—the Blessed One—has now entered for alms,”
and robed in their best, with perfumes, flowers, and such offerings
as they could give, they came into the street. There,
having paid their homage, some would implore him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reverend sir, let us feed ten monks,” and some, “Let us
feed twenty,” and the rich “Let us feed a hundred.” And the
most fortunate would take the bowl of the Blessed One and
fill it with food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had finished his meal, the Blessed One considering
what was suited to the minds of those who listened, would so
teach them the Law that many would attain to the fruit of
knowledge in its different degrees, and some in the highest—that
of a clear perception in saintship,—and having thus given
his good gifts to the multitude he would rise and return to the
quiet monastery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his arrival there he sat in a pavilion shaded from the
sun, on an excellent Buddha-mat which had been spread for
him, and there waited for the monks to finish their meal, and
when this was done he entered his chamber and bathed his
feet from the dust of travel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, standing, he exhorted the assembly of monks, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monks, diligently work out your salvation, for not often
is a Buddha—an Enlightened One—seen in the world—not
often is it possible thus to hear the Law. And if even an animal
can keep the Precepts, how much more a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at this point some would ask the Blessed One for exercises
in meditation and to each he assigned what suited
best their characters. And then all did obeisance to the Perfect
One, and dispersed to the places where they were in the
habit of spending the night or day, some to the forest, some
to the foot of trees, some, in meditation, to the heavenly places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Blessed One, then entering his chamber, would, if
wearied, lie down for awhile, not sleeping but mindful and
conscious and on his right side, as a lion takes his repose. And
when refreshed he rose, and sent his gaze through the world
(for to the Illuminated this is possible), to see who it was possible
he might aid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after this, the people of the village or town near which
he might be dwelling assembled, again in their best robes, and
he, approaching with majesty, took his seat on the Buddha-mat
in the little audience hall, and declared the doctrine to his
hearers who sat before him rapt in hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when they had made obeisance and departed it was the
custom of the Perfected One to bathe himself, and after that
to assume his tunic and girdle, and throwing his robe over his
right shoulder to go into his chamber and there fall into
deep meditation, and after that was the rest of the day given
to the monks who assembled, coming from here, there, and
everywhere, to question the Blessed Lord and ask his instructions
or plead for a sermon and all this he very gladly gave,
so consuming the first watch of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And during the middle watch of the night he would commune
with the blessed spirits of the Universe, they drawing very
near him in the true accord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the last watch of the night he divided into three parts,
and weary with much sitting he paced up and down considering
many things, and in the second part would enter his chamber
and rest, and in the third, seated, send the diamond-clear
ray of his perception through the world that he might commune
with any soul who needed that communion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus were spent the days of him who had attained the
<span class='it'>Paramitas</span>, the Ten Perfections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if there be any who would know of the ten, these are
they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almsgiving, morality, long-suffering, manliness, meditation,
mystic insight, resolution, strength, knowledge, and skill in
the choice of means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all these was our Lord perfected. And above even these
in Love. For hear the teaching of the Lord:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a mother, even at the risk of her own life, protects her
son, her only son, so let the disciple cultivate love without
measure toward all beings. Let him cultivate toward the
whole world above, below, around, a heart of love unstinted,
unmixed with differing or opposing interests. And let a man
maintain this mindful love whether he stands, walks, sits or
lies. For in all the world this state of heart is best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the Lord, the Blessed One, taught that this love must
increase until the wide Universe is suffused with its radiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our mind shall not waver. No evil speech will we utter.
Tender and compassionate will we abide, loving, void of malice.
And with rays of love shall we suffuse all that is, even with
love grown great and measureless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And because of this high teaching many men and women attained
to Arhatship, becoming perfected saints, seeing things
as they are in themselves and not according to their illusory
appearances in this world of illusion,—and they made great
songs of triumph and victory, saying that when the Hindrances
are removed from a man he is as one set free from debt, imprisonment,
and slavery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For when the five Hindrances are put away within him, he
is a free man and secure, and gladness springs up within him,
and joy, and so rejoicing all his frame becomes at ease, and
in that peace his heart is stayed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again, this song of Right Rapture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The shining Gods.” What then are these Gods and Shining
Ones? Thus have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surely the Gods are they who having acquired mighty merit
by great good deeds reign and shine for ages until the power
of their good deeds is exhausted. For they knew not the
Nirvana and the disintegration of the false self, and so desired
Paradise as their reward, and Paradise they have. But though
it last for ages, when the power of their good deeds is exhausted
then they too must enter again by the gate of birth and humbly
learn to extinguish all desire, even though it be the desire of
Heaven, and to know that the greedy <span class='it'>I</span> which desired these
things is non-existent, until they too, treading the Noble Eightfold
Path, enter upon the highest wisdom and attain to the Nirvana,
the Peace, for this alone is that comprehension which
beholds the heavens and hells as pictures, as illusions, as nothing,—and
whoso possesses it sits above manhood and Godhead
alike, having utterly attained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it must be when ignorance is dead and wisdom made
perfect, for the vain shows of ignorance are dispersed in clear
perception of the things that are true and eternal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the wise man by earnestness has driven vanity far
away, he has climbed the terraced heights of wisdom, and,
care-free, looks down upon the illusory world, the careworn
crowd, as he who standing upon a mountain top watches serenely
the toilers in the plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a man must have what he desires, be it the Paradises
that pass, or the Peace that is eternal.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now persons of all castes, high and low, women as
well as men, sought the teachings of the Lord—and
he received all with courtesy and gladness, for he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no caste in blood and tears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they brought him their griefs and questionings. And
very strange to them did it seem to behold a great Prince surrounded
by young men of the noble families who each and all
had thrown off the Hindrances of the illusory world and forsaking
all had followed the Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when they themselves had seen the light no longer did
it appear strange, for who will stay to watch a fragment of
broken glass flash in the sun, when before him pulse the great
lights of a royal jewel, brother of the sun and stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And about this time the beautiful harlot of Vaisali, the Lady
Amra, lovely as the divine Shri rising from the ocean, heard
that a great Lord of Wisdom was come to Vaisali, and she offered
him the use of her Garden of Mangoes outside the city
that he might rest in the delicious shade of her trees and in the
little pavilion where she took her pleasure, for she was rich in
gold and jewels and resembled a great Princess in pride and
beauty. But she did not herself think to see him, for the joy
of life held her as the nectar of flowers holds the clinging bee,
making his wings heavy so that he scarce can fly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her steward came to her, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O auspicious lady, I know not how it is, but all the nobles
and people are afoot, making their way to the Garden of
Mangoes, and when I asked the reason they replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is because of the man who rests there. There is none
like him—none! And he is the son of a King and has forsaken
his kingdom that he may find a greater.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she leaped to her feet laughing, ever ready for some
new sight, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it so? Then make ready my vehicle and I will go with
Subaddha to see the man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they harnessed her velvet-white oxen with tassels of
gold to her gilded car, and she took her place with the lady
Subaddha at her feet and a golden canopy above her head,
shining like the moon in her glory, and she went as a queen,
casting proud glances about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it was so early in the day that folk were busied with
their labours and the nobles were yet sleeping and the way was
clear before her, and the oxen trod quietly between the neem
trees and fan palms until she came to the gate of her Garden
of Mangoes, and there they halted in young sunlight and the
dew of dawn. And a man stood by the gate as though he
guarded it, and he was robed in yellow with one arm and shoulder
bare, and when she would have entered he stretched out his
arm and forbade her, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady, being such a woman as you are, how is it seemly that
you should enter this garden? Return whence you came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the blood fell away from her face and left her pale
at that saying, for she had lived all her life like a queen, and
now it seemed that scorn and the end were come upon her, and
her beauty nothing though she shone like a night of moon and
stars in her woven webs of gold. And silence fell upon her
as she looked upon this noble young man serene and beautiful,
who regarded her not, nor could she say, “The garden is mine,”
for she was afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So then, between the feathering palms and the bamboo leaves
that floated on still air, came another man, also clothed in the
yellow robe, but walking like a Prince, and he said softly to
the other:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay her not, brother Yasas, for our Master would look
upon her beauty. Descend, Lady, and follow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a little comforted at his saying she descended from
beneath the canopy and followed through the palms and the
mango trees that were her own and now seemed not hers.
And there was great quiet, for the monk said no word and
the leaves forbore to stir and not a cricket chirped and the
sun was very early and dewy in the green ways. And she
thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall I see? For kings and princes have feared my
beauty and I mocked them. And if he be wise, yet have the
stern ascetics of the forests—those whose power the very Gods
dreaded,—been seduced from their wisdom by the nymphs of
Heaven. They have gone utterly astray, and very certainly
I am beautiful as Menaka or Urvasi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, now they turned into a green way beside the still
pool where the lotuses bloomed, and it was cool and dim with a
deep shade of trees, for they let down pillared stems to root
again in earth and make a forest temple that scarcely a ray
might pierce. And within the shade was One seated with
folded hands and feet and behind his head a raying light that
shone like the midnight moon, and, lost in calm, he looked out
into the worlds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the man beside her fell on his knees and hid his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not for me, O, not for me, least of all the disciples is it
meet that I should tell of this or of the similitude of the Blessed
One—the very wise, the passionless, the desireless Lord in the
eyes of such as loved him. Only this I know, that the woman
stood amazed, forgetting her beauty, forgetting herself, forgetting
all in the Three Worlds but only that One. And the
rock crystal that was her heart melted within her and flowed
away in a river of tears: nor could she stay her feet, but slowly,
very slowly, she approached and before his feet she fell and
laid her face on the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now after awhile the Exalted One commanded her to rise
and be seated, and he incited and gladdened her with high
discourse so that she could no longer fear but only love in
hearing these great words with ears that drank them as the
parched earth yearns for the rains. And if it be asked how a
woman of evil life should thus be honoured, should thus harken
with love and understanding, I tell this thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many lives ago was there a deep forest where beasts and
birds dwelt and nourished their young in peace, but one day
a wind blew and brought on its wings a great fire. And none
had pity on the beasts and birds but one pheasant, glorious of
plumage, and this, caring nothing for her own life, plunged
into a stream of pure water, and flying upward shook the drops
from her feathers on the flames. Therefore Indra, King of the
Gods, seeing said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foolish bird! and what can this do? You weary yourself
in vain! This is a deed for the great and not for a little bird!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she: “You are Indra, King of Heaven, and with a wish
you could quench this fire, yet do not. But as for me while
it burns I have no time for words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again she flew against the fire, sprinkling water. And
the Great God blew with his breath, extinguishing the fire, but
the pheasant had perished. Now in that former life was the
Lady Amra that bird, and because the fruit of a high deed can
never perish so, passing through many lives, she attained at last
to lie at the feet of the Blessed One. Just and perfect is the
Law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, seated, at his feet, she received the Heart of Wisdom
and accepted the first noble Truth, the Truth of suffering.
And when the Exalted One judged that she could receive no
more that day, he dismissed her, and she bowed at his feet
and said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, may the Lord in deep compassion do me the honour of
eating at my house to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all assembled thought this could not be, but the Blessed
One gave by silence his consent, and circling reverently about
him three times she departed glad of heart, and the people
made way for one so honoured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the nobles of Vaisali had come out to meet the World-Honoured
and they were on the road, and Amra in the dancing
joy of her heart drove up against them, axle to axle, and they
said angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is it, Amra, that you, being such a one, drive up
against us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she cried aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noble persons, I have bidden the Exalted One for tomorrow’s
meal, and he comes—he comes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they halted amazed, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sell us the honour of his company for great weights of gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she, glowing with joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noble persons, were you to give me Vaisali and all its subject
territories yet would I not give up this honourable meal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the angry nobles cast up their hands, crying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are outdone by this mango-girl! We are out-reached
by this mango-girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in anger they proceeded to the garden and went in before
the Lord where he sat surrounded with calm, and they
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May the Exalted One do us the honour of taking his meal
together with his disciples at one house to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noble persons, I have promised to eat with the Lady Amra.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again they threw up their hands exclaiming:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are outdone by this mango-girl. Great shame to us is
this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Lord Buddha robed himself early in the morning
and took his begging bowl and his disciples followed, and he
went to the Street of Flowers, and Amra set sweet milk-rice
and cakes before the Lord and his followers and she herself
attended upon them in great humility and they ate the food
they had not thought to eat, and when it was eaten, she sat
lowly by his side and folding her hands, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy One, I present this house to the Order. Accept it, if
it be your will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Blessed One accepted the gift, seeing the heart that
made it, and after inciting and gladdening her with high discourse,
he rose and went his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in merciful deeds and right living this lady grew, and
the Heart of Wisdom strengthened in her, and in this very
life she became a perfected saint—a great Arhat—and entered
the Nirvana—the Peace. For, as the lotus flowers do not
grow on dry land but spring from black and watery mud, so
even by the strength of her passion and sin and the deeps of
experience she reached the heights. And she it was who made
The Psalm of Old Age, and smiled in its making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And inasmuch as the Sister thus discerned impermanance in
all phenomena, knowing the world we see is but the creation
of our senses, she, making clear her insight, attained, leaving
behind her all fear and grief. For who shall measure the
bounds and deeps and height and length of that wisdom that
is one with Love?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hear also the story of the very wise and glad and gay Lady
Visakha—that pillar of the Order, who abiding in the world as
a great lady of riches yet gave her heart to wisdom and the
Law of the Perfect One, for open is the way to all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was daughter to a great man, Balamitra, and was a young
maiden in her father’s house, when a Brahman commissioned
by the Treasurer Migara to choose a wife for his son came
that way, and when he arrived he saw Visakha and other girls
going into the wood in search of amusement, and he watched
them idly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the other girls were frivolous, running, skipping, whirling
about and singing, but Visakha walked quietly with them,
observing all and saying little. And when they came to the
tank the others carelessly stripped themselves and began to
play in the clear water. But Visakha lifted her clothes by
degrees as she entered and by degrees lowered them as she came
out, careful and modest in her conduct. And, after this, food
was distributed, and the other girls ate hurriedly and greedily
and then gave the remnants to their attendants. But Visakha
gave food first to those who served her, and then ate temperately
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Brahman, still watching, saw that as the girls returned
there was water across the path and the others took
off their shoes and waded, but Visakha remained shod, and
when they came to a wood she kept her sunshade up though
the others had lowered theirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there the Brahman came up with her, in much astonishment
and questioned her, and seeing him to be a holy and dignified
person she replied with respectful courtesy. And thus
he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear girl, whose daughter are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, I am the daughter of Balamitra.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear girl, be not angry if I question you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While those girls were skipping, dancing and twirling, with
other unseemly manners, you walked quietly; why, dear girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, great sir, all girls are their parents’ merchandise.
If in leaping and twirling I were to injure myself, I must be
kept by my parents while I live, for none would woo me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good, dear girl. I understand. Now, in entering the water
your companions stripped themselves but you went clothed
and modest. And why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O uncle, maidens must be shame-faced. It is not well for
them to be seen unclothed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear girl, there was none to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle, you saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good, dear girl. And again, the others neglected their attendants,
but you fed yours first. And why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For this reason, uncle; we have easy days and feastful;
they, hard work always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good, dear girl. And why in wading through the water did
you keep your shoes on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because in water one cannot see where one plants one’s
feet. I would not cut mine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And in the wood, dear girl, you kept your sunshade open.
Why? For then there was shade from the trees?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But also, uncle, the droppings of birds, the malice of
the monkeys letting fall unpleasant fragments, the falling of
leaves and twigs. In the open this seldom happens; in a wood
often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So full of delight at her good sense, the Brahman went to
her parents, and asked her in marriage for the son of Migara.
And he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This girl will make a noble wife and a great lady, for she
is full of thought for others and wise with the very wisdom
of the Law. Give her to the son of Migara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was granted and they sent her to her husband in the
city of Savatthi. Now Visakha was one who followed the
Enlightened One with all her wise heart, but it was not so with
Migara, her husband’s father, nor yet with his household.
But she gratified their eyes for they demanded the Five Beauties
in a daughter of the House, and these five she richly possessed
namely, beauty of hair, beauty of flesh, beauty of bone,
beauty of skin, and beauty of youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And beauty of hair is when the hair resembles a peacock’s
tail, falling to the end of the tunic where it curls upward.
Beauty of flesh, when the lips resemble a bright red gourd.
Beauty of bone, when the teeth gleam between the rosy lips like
cut mother-of-pearl, with even division. Beauty of skin, when
without the application of any cosmetic it is smooth as a lotus-wreath
and white as Kanikara flowers. Beauty of youth is
the endurance of the gaiety and freshness of youth after many
child-births. All these had Visakha, and yet another, for her
voice was sweeter than music, like the silver sounding of a little
gong. And on parting her father presented her with a magnificent
jewel adornment known as the Great Creeper Parure,
and a part of it consisted of a peacock with five hundred feathers
of red gold in each wing, the beak of coral, the eyes of
jewels and likewise the neck and tail-feathers. And on Visakha’s
head it resembled a peacock perched on a height, and it
gave forth music and appeared to be real.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when she was established in her new home she found
that Migara, her father-in-law, was a follower of the naked
ascetics, and they and he cast scorn on the Perfect One, and
this disturbed her much, and the ascetics said to Migara:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O householder, you have introduced into your family an
arrant misfortune breeder, a disciple of the monk Gotama.
Expel her instantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is not easy!” thought Migara, “for she comes of a
great family,—But I will take measures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he sat down and began to eat sweet rice-milk from a golden
bowl, and Visakha stood before him, dutifully fanning him.
And a holy mendicant entered with his begging bowl for alms,
but Migara made as though he did not see him, and ate on,
keeping his head down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pass on, reverend sir!” said Visakha with courtesy. “My
father is eating stale food—it would not be agreeable to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when she said this, Migara leaped to his feet and cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take away this food and drive the girl from the house.
To think the slut should accuse <span class='it'>Me</span> of eating stale food, and
at a time of festival!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father!” said Visakha, with composed serenity. “I shall
not easily leave the house. For I am no harlot picked up at
some river bathing place, but a great lady. And my father
foresaw such a case, and when I left commanded eight householders
of this town to investigate any charge brought against
me. Summon them now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Migara agreed joyfully, knowing what they must adjudge
to such insolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they came—eight grave and wise men, and the story
was told. And when it was heard:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear girl,” said the eldest householder, “is it as he says?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not as <span class='it'>I</span> say! For when my father-in-law ignored
the monk I said ‘He is eating stale fare.’ And I meant this—He
is uselessly consuming the merit acquired in a former life
instead of making fresh. Now, what fault was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None, dear girl. Our daughter speaks justly. Why are
you angry with her, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sirs, granted that was no fault,—But when she came to us
her mother gave her ten admonitions of a hidden meaning, and
I dislike them. First: ‘The indoor fire is not to be taken out
of doors.’ Now you know it is the friendly custom to send
fire to our neighbours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it as he says, dear girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good sirs, this is the meaning: ‘If you notice any fault
in any of your new family, never tell it outside the house. For
there is no worse fire than this.’ Was this a fault in me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Migara was ashamed and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sirs, I grant this. But she was also instructed thus:
‘Outdoor fire must not be brought indoors.’ It is the custom
to accept fire if ours should go out, and therefore this was an
unseemly instruction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And seated in a row and consulting, the householders appointed
their eldest to answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it as he says, dear girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, good sirs. The meaning is—‘If any outside the house
speak ill of any within, never repeat it within doors. For there
is no fire like the tongue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well and good, dear girl. And the rest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was instructed. ‘Give to him who gives and also to him
who does not give,’ and this means ‘Be liberal to needy relatives
and friends whether they can repay you or no.’ And
again: ‘Sit happily.’ And this means—‘When you see your
father-in-law or his wife or your husband, you must rise and
stand before them.’ ‘Eat happily.’ This means—‘They must
be served by you before you eat yourself.’ ‘Wait upon the
fire.’ This signifies, ‘These three must be looked upon as beautiful
as a flame of fire or a royal serpent.’ ‘Reverence the
household divinities.’ This means that these three are your
divinities indeed. ‘Sleep happily.’ This means ‘You must not
lie down to sleep till you have done all possible services for
them.’ All these rules, good sirs, I have kept. Now am I in
fault?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Migara sat with downcast eyes and the eight said to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Treasurer, is there any other sin in our daughter for she
is clear of any wrong in all this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. None.” But Visakha then arose in just anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good sirs,” she said, “It would not have been fitting that
I should be dismissed, yet now I am found guiltless I will go.
It is a good time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she ordered her many carriages and slaves to be made
ready. But Migara implored her to remain with them, half
in fear and half in shame. And when she refused he redoubled
his entreaties, and asked her forgiveness earnestly. And she
replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good sir, what there is to pardon I pardon cheerfully. But
I am daughter to a family which follows the Law of the Exalted
One. If I can be allowed to attend upon the Assembly,
then I will stay. Not otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear girl, wait on your Assembly as you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the end of the matter was that Migara went with Visakha
to hear the World-Honoured, doubtful and unwilling, and
it appeared to Migara, as it did always to all, that the eyes of
the Buddha were fixed steadfastly on him and his proclamation
of the Law addressed to him, and to him only. And Migara
heard and the words reached his innermost being and he became
established in the truth and acquired an immovable faith
in the Three Refuges—the Law, the Lord, and the Assembly.
And he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly it was for my advantage, truly it was for my good
that my daughter-in-law came to my house,” and when he returned,
he touched her breast with his hand, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Henceforth you are as my mother,” thus giving her the position
of honour. And he caused to be made for her an ornament
known as the Highly Polished Parure, and gave it to her under
the eyes of the Buddha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she continued to give alms and to do many deeds of
merit, and as the crescent moon rounds in the sky she became
great in sons and daughters, ten of each. She lived to be an
hundred and twenty years old, and not one grey hair was seen
upon her head, insomuch that when she walked to the monastery
with her children and their children, people asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is the great Visakha?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they said: “That great lady who walks so lightly,”
and the others replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May she walk further! Our lady looks well when she
walks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And those who saw her stand, sit, or lie, would say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope she may do each a little longer. Our lady looks
well in all she does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that it could not be charged against her that there was
any posture in which she did not look well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And great and magnificent were her charities to all who
needed. And even the great Creeper Parure she gave for
the needy, and redeemed it with a King’s ransom, and she
attended upon the sick, healing them with wise medicaments,
and she built a monastery and it is easy to rehearse what she
did not do that was good, but impossible to rehearse all her
innumerable nobilities of deed and thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was of her the One who is Awakened said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just, monks, as a skilful garland-maker if he obtain a
heap of flowers will go on making beautiful garlands without
end, even so does the mind of Visakha incline to do all manner
of noble deeds weaving them into loveliness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this is the history of that great, generous and happy lady,
the daughter of the Law.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this time the Queen Prajapati, she who had
nourished the Blessed One with noble milk when his
mother Maya was received into Paradise, sent to our Lord, with
a message from herself and from the Princess Yashodara and
other ladies of the royal family, and it was this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Full of hindrances is the household life, very free the life
of the homeless for such as would walk in the way. Let the
Blessed One, the Happy One, permit that women also retire
to the peace of the homeless life under the discipline taught by
the Exalted Lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was silent, and a second time they made their petition,
for they thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much need have women of the Peace, and is the way closed
to them only?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Queen Prajapati came herself and besought him
with tears, and he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough, Lady. Do not make this request,” and weeping
and saluting him with reverence she left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So wandering from place to place and teaching by the way,
the Blessed One came to Vaisali and stayed awhile in the
Pagoda Hall, and when she knew where she could find him the
Queen Prajapati with shorn hair and yellow robes, followed
by a number of the Sakya women journeyed along the dusty
ways to Vaisali and stood in the porch of the Pagoda Hall
weeping and very sorrowful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it so chanced that the disciple Ananda, cousin of the
Exalted One and much loved by him (and he was chosen
to wait always about his person), saw those weeping women
stand in the porch, dusty and foreworn with the long journey
and their tender feet swollen and cut with unwonted
travel, and he pitied them and inquired into the cause of
their grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And having heard all he approached the Blessed One with
reverence where he sat full of peace looking out into the green
shade of the nyagrodha trees, and after salutation Ananda the
beloved sat down beside him waiting until the Lord turned his
eyes serenely upon him. And then said Ananda:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reverend Sir, here in the entrance stands Prajapati the
Queen with swollen feet, sorrowful and weeping, and her word
is that the Blessed One will not permit women to retire to the
homeless life. Exalted One, I beseech you for these. Let
their petition be heard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Blessed One replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough, Ananda. Do not ask this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again and yet again the beloved Ananda besought and
still the Lord refused. And then the thought occurred to
Ananda that he might ask in another manner with more success,
for he pitied the women for this great denial of their
hope. And he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, if women retire to the homeless life is it possible for
them to attain to the goal of returning only once more to
rebirth? Is it possible that escaping from sorrow they should
attain to saintship?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Blessed One in whom is all truth, answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the face of Ananda gladdened even like his name which
signifies Joy, and he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I beseech the Perfected One to consider how great
a benefactress to the Order has been the Queen. She is sister
to the mother of the Blessed One and at her breast was he
nourished. I beseech and yet again beseech that they be admitted,
for if it be possible that they thus make an end of
sorrow shall not this be permitted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then said the Blessed One:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard is it to refuse and I cannot. If therefore these
women will accept eight weighty regulations in addition to
those accepted by the Order—eight weighty regulations making
them subject to the Order, it shall be reckoned to them for
ordination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he had received the eight weighty regulations
hard to be borne, for they set the oldest and most venerable of
nuns below the youngest and least of the Order, Ananda went
out to the Queen and told her all as she stood patiently with
the wearied women. And when they heard the regulations
sorrow passed from them as when the moon escaping
from a cloud floats in pure radiance in pure air, and the
Queen answered for Yashodara and for all those tender
ones:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reverend Ananda, as a woman young, beautiful, and loving
to beautify herself, having obtained a wreath of blue lotus-flowers,
or of perfumed jasmin, takes it and wreathes her head
with joy, so do we. O venerable Ananda, we take up those
eight weighty regulations, not to be transgressed while life
lasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was their ordination, as the Exalted One had said,
and Ananda returned to the Lord and told him of their joy.
And he meditated and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If, Ananda, women had not retired to the homeless life,
under my discipline then would religion have endured long
in this country, even a thousand years. But now, not very long
will the discipline and religion endure. And just as a man
prudently builds a dike in order that water confined may not
transgress its bounds, have I laid down the eight weighty regulations.
Yet shall it not endure, since women have accepted the
rules.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And true it is that in India the faith has not endured, but
over the rest of Asia has it spread, strong and mighty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the women were glad at heart, for the homeless life drew
them with the very passion of peace and many became great
saints, some dwelling in forests and in caves, and great to them
was the joy of peace in the solitudes far from crowds, and they
were filled with the life of trees and great forests and the
strength of the up-running sap and the speechless communion
and growth of trees and plants. And in many joy broke forth
in words and they made the Psalms of the Sisters, even as
their brothers the monks also sang for joy and could no more
be silent than birds at dawn, and the world they had known
called to ears that heard no longer. And thus it called:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young and old they rejoiced, and the solitudes were kind to
them, admitting them to fellowship. And one aged sister spoke
this:</p>

          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Though I be suffering and weak and all</p>

<p class='line0'>My little bowl o’er-turned; so sit I here</p>

<p class='line0'>The Triple Lore! The Buddha’s will be done.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>For now, they who had been the prisoners of man and of
opinion learnt the beauty of the solitudes, and knew the silence
that is in the starry sky, the sleep that is among the lonely hills,
and it became theirs, and they attained to the coolness, purity
and luminance of the Peace, bathing in it as in moonlit water.
For they had passed through the Three Grades of Training,
the Higher habit of Conduct, the Higher Consciousness, and the
Higher Wisdom, and thus, knowing the world, not as it appears
to be but as it is, knowing “This is Ill; this is the cause of Ill;
this is the way leading to the cessation of Ill,” they were glad,
and right ecstasy was theirs and joys that cannot be told, and
they were free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And another said this:</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“One day bathing my feet, I sit and watch</p>

<p class='line0'>Then, going to my cell, I take my lamp,</p>

<p class='line0'>Taking the pin I pull the wick right down</p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>Thus very great joy had come to be by the Blessed One’s
sufferings, and for each pang he had paid came a golden harvest
of the peace of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Him who had thus Attained came men and women from
far and near with doubts and questions, and seated with dignity
(for his noble Aryan birth was upon him as well as the
Peace) he received them all, answering and resolving their
doubts, nor was it difficult for him to do this for his eyes were
as the sun in his strength to divide light from darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet let it be well understood that of certain things he would
not speak, counting them beyond human knowledge and knowing
well that in no human speech are there words to bear the
burden of the Ineffable. Therefore when men asked him of
the Beginning, how division from the Eternal into the false ego-self
came into the world and from what well of bitterness evil
thought and evil doing flowed to become tears and blood in
their flowing, he would not answer, for none but a Buddha can
comprehend the deepest, and he only in ways beyond transmission
to others. And he would say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The arrow sticks in the wound, will you wait before the
healer draws it out to enquire of what wood is it made and
whether the bowstring is of hair or vegetable fibre? Life
is ebbing while you theorize credulously about present and
future, self or identity. Of the origins I do not teach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when again they besought him to say whether life or
nothingness lay beyond death, only his own nearest disciples
could read the fathomless depths of his calm, looking
rather to this than to his speech. For he said, being alone
with them to whom it was given to know:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this world of forms and illusions created by our senses,
according to our illusion a man either is or is not, either lives
or dies, but in the true and formless world this is not so for
all is otherwise than according to our knowledge and it is easier
to answer in negatives than in affirmatives. And if you
ask Does a man live beyond death, I answer No, not in any
sense comprehensible to the mind of man which itself dies at
death. And if you ask does a man altogether die at death, I
answer No, for what dies is what belongs to this world of form
and illusion, that is the false I, but beyond this is another world
incomprehensible as yet to such as are not instructed and beyond
all human categories, so that if I would I cannot tell you
of it, but I would not, for the things are disturbing and do not
aid the traveller on the only path which can bring him to
their threshold. Therefore of that and of the origins I do not
teach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this ego which the unenlightened believes to be himself,
very certainly falls apart and dissolves at death, nor is there
any place of continuance for it, and it is wholly extinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it so happened that one day a wandering monk, by
name Vacchagotta, came to the Exalted One, and saluting him
with friendly greetings he sat down beside him, and he asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How does the matter stand, venerated Gotama? In a man
is there the Ego?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Exalted One was silent, and Vacchagotta asked
again and yet again and still there was silence, and after awhile
he rose and went away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the beloved Ananda came to Him who has thus Attained,
and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sir, did you not answer the wandering monk Vacchagotta?”
And, smiling, he looked in the face of the beloved
Ananda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If, Ananda, when he asked me, I had answered ‘The ego
is,’ then that reply would have confirmed the teaching of those
who believe in the permanence of that false ego which is a
bundle of tendencies and consciousness and proudly calls itself
I and the Soul; and if I had said the ego is not, this would have
confirmed the teaching of those who say there is annihilation
and nothing beyond death. For neither of these schools, nor
yet Vacchagotta, know the distinction between the ego of
which he asked me and the true Ego, for this last is eternal and
beyond comprehension, and the false ego passes and is gone like
a dream in the awakening of dawn. Therefore since Vacchagotta
has not attained to the threshold of that knowledge, being
prisoned in the world of appearances, what could I do but keep
silence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the beloved Ananda laid his hand upon his mouth and
retired, for with all his heart of love he had not yet attained
to the full insight of the unreality of appearances, but where
he could not understand he loved. And love is also the Way,
as witness the monk Purna who was about to carry the light
into a land of violent and perilous people. So the Perfected
One sent for him, and asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if, monk, these people abuse and injure you, what will
be your thought?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That these people are good in that they only abuse me
and do not beat me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if they beat you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall think they are good in that they only beat me
and do not stab me with swords.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if with swords?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall think: They are good. They leave me my
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if they take your life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,—They are good to me in that they have lifted a burden
from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And looking upon his face the World-Honoured said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well have you spoken, Purna. Go and deliver, you who
have delivered yourself. Comfort, for you are comforted.
Guide to the Peace, for you have entered it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Purna went in joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was a monk named Yamaka who, considering the
teaching, believed that on the dissolution of the body the man
who has lost all depravity is annihilated and exists no more.
And his fellow monks having in vain urged him to abandon so
wicked a heresy called upon Sariputta the Great to teach him
better, and by his silence he consented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when the evening was come, Sariputta the Great rose from
deep meditation and drawing near to Yamaka he greeted him
with courtesy as one monk should another and sitting down respectfully
beside him he questioned him thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the report true, brother Yamaka, that the wicked heresy
of annihilation has sprung up in your mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so, brother, do I understand the teaching of the
Blessed One.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Sariputta the Great mused a moment and resumed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What think you, brother Yamaka;—is his bodily form the
saint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No indeed, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are sensation, perception, predispositions, the saint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then can you consider the saint as apart and distinct from
form, sensation, perception and predispositions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother, I cannot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if separately they are not, are they when united the
saint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what think you, brother Yamaka? If you cannot
prove the very existence of the saint in this world of forms
and appearances, is it reasonable for you to say that at death
the saint is annihilated and does not exist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And holding down his head for shame Yamaka answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Sariputta, it was through ignorance I held that
wicked heresy, but now I have acquired the True Doctrine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Sariputta the Great taught as did his Master that the
true being is detached from each of these delusive selves of
consciousness, sensation, perception, and predispositions, and
the saint who has attained has detached himself even in this
life from belief that these are himself—his ego. How then
should it be that the essential perishes when these dissolve
with the dying brain in death? Yet has this wicked heresy
been spread, though clear as day must it be made to those who
tread the way that it is a lie and no truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For thus have I heard. After the death of the Perfected
One, the King of Kosala, journeying from Savatthi, met with
the learned nun Khema, renowned for wisdom, and the King,
respectfully saluting her, asked her of the Teaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Venerable Lady, the Perfect One is dead. Does he exist
after death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great King, the Exalted One has not declared that he exists
after death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, venerable Lady, does the Perfect One not exist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Perfect One has not declared that he does not exist
after death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, venerable Lady,—does and does not? How is this
possible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, smiling a little, the learned nun replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great King, have you an accountant or a mint-master who
could count the sands of Ganges and lay the figure before you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Venerable Lady, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or who could measure the drops in the ocean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again no, venerable Lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why? Because the ocean is deep, immeasurable, unfathomable.
So also is it if the existence of the Perfect One be
measured by any human category, for all statements of bodily
form are abolished in the Perfect One; their root is severed;
they are done with and can germinate no more. The Perfect
One is released from the possibility that his being can be gauged
in any human terms. He is now deep, immeasurable and unfathomable
as the ocean, and neither the terms of existence or
of non-existence as understood by the world fit him any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was a long silence and the King having heard
the nun Khema’s words with approbation, rose and bowed
reverently before her and went his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor can the tongue tell of
such matters for they are beyond and above us. And it is
for this reason that the Blessed One replied thus to the venerable
Malukya, when he reproached the Perfect One as
follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the world eternal or the slave of time? Does the World-Honoured
live on beyond death? It pleases me not at all that
all these important matters should remain unanswered. May
it please the Master to answer them if he can. And if he
does not know let him say so plainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Master replied with his smile:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I say to you, Malukya,—‘Come and be my disciple,
and I will teach you whether the world is everlasting or finite,
whether the vital faculty is separate from the body or one
with it, whether the Exalted One lives or does not live after
death?’ Did I promise all this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, you did not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, Malukya, if a man is struck by a poisoned arrow,
suppose he says—‘I will never allow my wound to be treated
until I know who shot the arrow—was it a man of high or
low caste. And I must know whether he is tall or short, and
how his bow and arrows are made!’—Would this be a sensible
proceeding? Surely no. He would die of his wounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why have I not made these things clear? Because the
knowledge of them does not conduce to holiness nor right detachment,
nor to peace and enlightenment.—What is needed
for these I teach, the truth of suffering and its origin, the
truth of the Way to its cessation. Therefore let what I have
not revealed rest, and follow that which I have revealed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Malukya was content, knowing at last that in this life
these questions are deep, mysterious and unanswerable, and the
sole way to their understanding is to live the life, untroubled
by controversy and dogma on such things as cannot be uttered
in terms of human knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For there is a Knowledge veiled in excess of light which
dazzles the eyes to blindness. Let words be few. Let good
deeds be many. He understands it for whom it passes thought.
Who thinks of it can never know it. And if it could be told
in words it would not be the Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there is yet another example of this. For once in early
days the Blessed One sat high among his own upon the Peak
of Vultures, and there came before his quiet feet a Shining
One and laid there a golden flower, praying that he would
speak and in sweet speech instruct them of the innermost of
the Peace. The Blessed One received the golden flower within
his hand and sat in utter calm but spoke no word and all the
Assembly mused what this might mean, and, musing, could
not know. But at long last, Kassapa the Great smiled, also
in silence, and the Blessed One said softly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hold within my heart the Treasure of the Law, the wondrous
knowledge that is the Peace. This have I given to
Kassapa wordless, and wordless he has seen and known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So passes the vision from heart to heart. But words cannot
tell it to the brain.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Brahman, high and haughty, having great possessions
and full of this world’s power, raised his voice
railing against the teaching of the Holy One, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this is against the teaching of the Vedanta! Who shall
hear Gotama the Sakya when he teaches thus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he came proudly from Rajagriha far off, and stood beside
to hear, that he might scoff at his ease, but the nobleness
of the teacher drew him as with the kindred understanding of
high birth, and the marvellous deeps of the Law caught him
by the pride of his intellect for he thought it was too high for
the foolish, and the wisdom beyond all words that falls like dew
on the thirsty soul subdued him into an amazing quiet, and
when it was done he went alone into the wood and sat himself
in the shade by a clear running stream and considered these
things in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he could not stay away for cords drew him and bonds
were forged between him and That Other and they were
smithied in iron unbreakable. So after awhile he rose, and
hanging his head went back to the Jetavana monastery and demanded
to see the World-Honoured, and when he came, this
Brahman Vasettha made due salutation and seated himself respectfully
beside him, and he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been told to me, Gotama, that the monk Gotama
knows the way to the state of union with the Ultimate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Perfect One replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is to be known I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So has it been told to me, Gotama. It is well. Let the
venerable Gotama be pleased to show me the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then said the Happy One:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know, Vasettha, that from time to time is born into the
world a fully Enlightened One happy with knowledge of the
Truth, a Blessed Buddha, and he sees as it were face to face
this Universe, freed from his senses in that they no longer can
shape illusions to blind and deceive him, for with ordinary men
their thought creates shapes about them, a false world in which
they believe and are blinded. But it is not so with the Buddhas
for they see things as they are. Then do they proclaim this
truth of the Universe as it is, lovely in origin, lovely in progress,
lovely in consummation, and this is to be known by the
higher life, which is the Way to Wisdom in all its purity and
perfectness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Brahman Vasettha as in a dream, fixed, unconscious
of all else, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak, Lord,—I hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Lord said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are two levels of the Way. One for the monk, one
for the householder, and of the monk I speak first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He takes nothing that is not his own. He is content with
what is given, and honesty and a pure heart are his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His life is pure, having put aside the habit and thought of
sexual intercourse. This is for the householder only, but in
all purity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From truth in speech he cannot swerve, faithful and trustworthy,
he hurts no man by deceit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slander is not for him, and calumny dies upon his tongue.
He is a binder together of those who are divided, a peacemaker,
a peace-lover, impassioned for peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From him come no harsh words. Whatever word is humane
and lovely, pleasing and comforting, that he speaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foolish talk and idle words are not his. In season he speaks
what redounds to profit and wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will not injure any creature. He eats but once a day.
Gay and trivial shows are not for him. He does not adorn
himself richly, for this is folly for a grown man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For riches, be it in silver and gold and jewels, or flocks and
herds he has no desire, and putting field to field does not tempt
him who knows the world as it Is. And as for any deed of
fraud or violence the possibility of it is not in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor will he teach magical spells nor gain a living or influence
by any such arts or lying practices. And among the disturbed
and careful, he moves serene and pure, as the moon,
freed from clouds, pursues her way in midnight skies, shedding
her light abroad to guide the wayfarer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Vasettha, musing, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is no low teaching. This is the way of a great nobleman,
and such are his manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Blessed One:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true. And there is more. Having attained right conduct
within and without, he sets his mind free like a bird uncaged
from the self, to pervade the four quarters of the world
with love and sympathy, and as a mighty trumpeter makes
himself heard with ease in all the four directions, so there is
no living thing he passes by, but surrounds them with love,
grown great and beyond measure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when Love is attained, the way to be one with the Supreme
is known and is not far from him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was a silence, and the Brahman Vasettha said
slowly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Venerable Gotama, I have been a liberal giver: justly I
sought riches, bountifully I bestowed them. Was this well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Blessed One replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well. Yet have I shown you a more excellent way, for
love is the path of wisdom to true understanding and union
with all that is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Brahman said with passion:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Instruct me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the Perfect One opened to him the Way and, seated beside
him, the Brahman Vasettha learned the Four Noble
Truths of suffering, the truth, the cause, the cessation, and the
way that leads to its extinction. And immediately there arose
within him forgetfulness of all his riches and wisdom came
upon him—the Light-bearer, so that he knew illusions for what
they are and saw the Universe about him wholly fair, being
united with it as a bridegroom with a bride. And seeing being
substituted for blindness, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most excellent, Lord, are the words of your mouth, most
excellent! Just as if a man were to bring a lamp into the
darkness so that all is seen clear, so is the truth made known
by the Blessed One. And I, even I, betake myself to the
Blessed One as my refuge, and to the Truth and the Brotherhood.
May I be accepted!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Blessed One replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, monk! Well taught is the Doctrine. You have
broken every fetter. You have made an end of pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Vasettha was made one of the Brotherhood and glad at
heart he exalted the word of the Blessed One.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was that even the Shining Ones desired instruction
of the Perfect One.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When He who has thus Attained dwelt in the monastery of
Jetavana, once there came to him a Shining One in the dead of
night, and the place was lit up by the clear luminance that
streamed from his body. And this Shining One placed himself
neither too far nor too near, but where he should rightly
be, and bowing low thus he addressed the Buddha:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most Excellent, during the twelve years of teaching many
Shining Ones desiring to reach the holiness of the Peace have
striven to discover what things are blessed, and still are ignorant.
Instruct us therefore in those matters which are most
blessed. Pronounce the Beatitudes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Perfected One replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of Light, to shun the company of the foolish, to
pay homage to the learned, to worship what is worship-worthy,
these are blessed things. Son of Light, mark them
well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of Light, to dwell among good men: to hold within the
consciousness of good deeds done in a former state of existence,
to guard well the actions;—Son of Light, these are blessed
things. Mark them well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of Light, to hear and see much in order to acquire
knowledge, to study all science that does not lead to sin, to use
right language, to study right manners, these are blessed things.
Son of Light, mark them well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of Light, to treat parents with tenderness and love, to
guard wife and children, to do no evil when tempted, these are
blessed things. Son of Light, mark them well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of Light, to make offerings and give nobly, to follow
the precepts of law and virtue, to assist relations and friends:
these are blessed things, Son of Light, mark them well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of Light, to avoid sin steadfastly, to abstain from strong
drink, to lay up great treasure of good deeds: these are blessed
things. Son of Light, mark them well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of Light, to reverence those who are worthy of veneration,
to walk in humility, to dwell in content and gratitude, to
hear the teaching of the Law; these are blessed things. Son of
Light, mark them well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of Light, to be patient and endure suffering, to rejoice
in good words, to visit saintly persons when possible, to talk
on high matters; these are blessed things. Son of Light, mark
them well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of Light, to practise holy austerities, to walk steadfast
in the Truth with eyes fixed on the attainment of the Peace:
these are blessed things. Son of Light, mark them well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of Light, to be unmoved, to be of serene mind, exempt
from passion, composed and fearless amid all earthly dangers:
these are blessed things. Son of Light, mark them well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Son of Light, whoever possesses these blessings shall
never be overcome; shall in all things find joy. Son of Light,
mark them well, thus attaining the peace of the Arhats, the
Perfected Saints.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus replied the World-Honoured and the Shining One
heard and went away content. And it is told that it was the
beloved Ananda who handed down this discourse to the ages,
having received it from the Blessed One, and mark it well, for
in a little compass it contains all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Praise be to the Possessor of the Six Glories, the Holy, the
All-Wise!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now of the bodily presence of the Blessed One will I say
this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When age came upon him it came with beauty, so that all
hearts fell at his feet and embraced them because he was as
one to whom all evil things must fly for refuge that being
delivered from the self they might be made one with him and
the Truth. And none could see him without this desire. Nor
in his presence was virtue remembered for he was virtue’s self
made manifest in love, and in the ocean of love were all submerged
who saw him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was worn and calm as in an image of royal ivory,
his nose prominent and delicate, bespeaking his Aryan birth,
his eyes of a blue darkness, and he carried himself as one of
the princes. But all this might be said of another, and there
was none like him—none! For Wisdom walked on his left
hand and Love on his right, and light as of the sun surrounded
him. Wise and piercing were his words, delighting even those
who would have scoffed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And once the Holy One approached with his begging bowl
the ploughed fields of a rich man and stood apart, waiting, and
the man saw this saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having ploughed and sown I eat. You also should plough
and sow, for the idle shall not eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I also, Brahman, plough and sow.” Thus said the Perfected
One.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet we do not see the plough of the Venerable Gotama!”
so said the other, mocking. And the World-Honoured answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faith is the seed, understanding the yoke and plough, tenderness
the deliverance. So is my ploughing done. And the
fruit is immortality, and having thus ploughed a man is freed
of all ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Brahman poured rice-milk into a bowl and offered
it, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the Blessed One eat of the rice-milk for he also is a
ploughman who makes to grow the fruit of immortality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this man also entered the Way and became glad at heart,
having heard the Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Holy One talked with men and women of all ranks
and affairs, so that the mind of none was hidden from him, and,
even as they felt, he knew, and their hopes and fears were not
far from him. Fathomless were the wisdom and compassion
of Him who has thus Attained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So also with women, from the queens to the weaver-maidens
they feared not to implore his mercy. Very patiently and according
to the measure of their weakness he instructed them,
and they grew like bamboos in a night shooting up to the
light with glory of leaf and stem. And surely in these tender
ones the Lord beheld the likeness of his mother, of whom
it was said, “Joyful and reverenced of all, even as the young
moon, strong and calm of purpose as the earth, pure of heart
as the lotus, was Maya the Great Lady.” And of these women
many became nuns and teachers, and not a few attained unto
the Perfect Enlightenment passing even in this life into that
Nirvana wherein are no more birth and death. And even the
light women sought him in hope and he drove them not away,
and wisdom rose within them like a wind of fire and burnt
away all dross and alloy and they too entered the Way and
wielded the powers, perceiving the Love in which all loves are
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet let it not be thought that because of this compassion
the Lord at any moment relaxed the watchfulness of those
who followed him, knowing well that of all snares women
may be the very worst. Stern were the rules he made for
the men who live on the austere heights of contemplation,
strait the fences about the way. For the householders, purity
in marriage, kindness reverence to mother, sister, wife, daughter,
in their daily duties. For all, watchfulness and discipline
lest the foot slip in the mire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And one day, when they rested in the shade on a journeying,
Ananda the well-beloved, cousin of the Lord, asked an instruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, how should we who are monks, conduct ourselves
with regard to women-kind, for this is a hard matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Excelling One said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See them not, Ananda.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so, Lord. But if we should see them, what then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Abstain from speech, Ananda.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so, Lord. But if they should speak to us, what
then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep wide awake, Ananda.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And O that it were possible to set down the laughter of
the Lord among his own, and the sweet converse when he related
to them the stories of his former births, and whether
parables or truths, how is it possible for the not wholly enlightened,
who know not their own chains of births, to say?
But wise were these stories and sweet and full of teaching for
the little ones of the Law and babes might run to hear and
laugh, and yet again the wisest pause and ponder the noble
truths hidden in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hear now a Birth Story of the Lord. For this is called
the Holy Quail, and the Blessed One told it as he and his went
through a jungle. For there a very great jungle fire arose
and roared toward them very terribly, and some would have
made counter-fire and burned the ground before it, but others
cried aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monks, what is it you would do? Surely it is madness,
for we journey with the Master who can do All. And yet,
making a counter-fire you would forget the power of the Buddhas!
Come, let us go to the Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they went, and the flame came roaring on to the place
where they stood, and when it came within fifteen rods of the
Blessed One it was extinguished like a torch plunged in water,
and they magnified him. But he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monks, this was not due to my power but to the faith of
a Quail. Hear this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so, Lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the beloved Ananda folded a robe and spread it as a
seat and he sat and told this tale:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this very spot long, long ago, was a young Quail, and he
lay in the nest and his parents fed him, for he could neither
fly nor walk. And with a mighty roar there came a jungle
fire and all the birds fled shrieking away and even his parents
deserted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the young Quail lay there alone, and he thought this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I fly, could I walk, I might be saved, but I cannot.
No help have I from others and in myself is none. What
then shall I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he reflected thus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this world is Truth if it can be found. There are also
the Buddhas who have seen the Truth and have shown it
abroad, and in the Buddhas is love for all that lives. In me
also is the Truth (though but a poor little Quail) and faith
that has power. Therefore it behoves me, relying on these
things to make an Act of Faith and thus to drive back the fire
and find safety for myself and the other birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the Quail called to mind the Powers of the Buddhas, the
Truth-Seers, and making a solemn asseveration of faith existing
in himself he said this:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Wings have I that cannot fly,</p>
<p class='line0'>Feet I have that cannot walk.</p>
<p class='line0'>My parents have forsaken me,</p>
<p class='line0'>O all-devouring fire, go back!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“And before this Act of Faith the fire dropped and died, retreating.
And the Quail lived his life in the forest and passed
away according to his deeds, and because of his strength of
faith fire dies for ever when it touches this spot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So said the Excellent One, and when he had finished this
discourse he made the connection and summed up, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My parents at that time were my present parents, and the
Quail was I myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they marvelled and were instructed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And one day two monks approached him, having travelled
far, and according to his manner he said in welcoming them:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it well with you, monks? Are you able to live? Have
you passed the rains in peace and unity, and have you experienced
any lack of support?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not well with us, Blessed One, for there is great anger
between us, and we devour our hearts with bitterness and know
no peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they laid their case before him in mutual hatred, and
he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He abused me! He beat me! In those who harbour such
thoughts how can hatred die? By oneself evil is done. By
oneself one suffers. The swans go on the path of sun, they
go through the air by means of their miraculous power. In a
man’s power is his salvation from evil. There is no fire like
passion: there is no losing throw like hatred. Let a man leave
anger, let him forsake pride. Let him overcome anger by love
and conquer the liar by truth. For hatred ceases not at any
time by hatred, but only by love. This is an old rule.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old rule. Yet when the Lord spoke it from his heart of
bliss it became a new commandment and wisdom. So these
two saluted one another in love before the face of the Perfect
One, and, hand clasped in hand, they left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again when a young monk was led away by the transient
smile of a woman to his undoing, the Perfected One said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rise above the five senses which see things as they are not,
and open the sight which see things as they are. Even the
Divine Beings may well envy him whose desires like horses well
broken are utterly subdued. Him whom no false desires can
lead captive any more, by what temptation can he be felled—he
the Awakened, the all-seeing, the desireless? And make
thought pure, for all that we are is the result of what we have
thought. It is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our
thoughts. If a man speaks or acts from an evil thought pain
follows him as the wheel follows the ox that draws the carriage.
Earnest among the thoughtless, awake among the
drowsy, the wise man presses steadily onward to joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they said, “Even so, Lord,” and seeing their faces glad
about him, he added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As on a heap of refuse cast forth by the highway a lily may
grow filling the air with sweetness, thus the disciples of the
true Buddha shine forth among the people who walk in darkness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And on another day when they talked of the lures of desire,
the Lord said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As long as the evil deed does not bear fruit the fool thinks
it sweet as honey, but later comes the bitterness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when the evil deed is thrown upward in recklessness,
like a stone it falls back on the fool and breaks his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For those who will not learn, who cannot as yet understand,
hard to follow is the path of the wise man, like that of birds
flying home through trackless depths of air. But what is difficult
may with taking thought be done. The arrow-maker
trues his arrow, the carpenter shapes his log, the wise man
shapes himself, for no other hand can do it. Tranquil are his
thoughts, serene his meditation when he has obtained freedom
by knowledge. But the beginning is this—Let no man think
lightly of the beginning of evil, saying—‘It is only a little
thing,’ for by the falling of water drops one by one, a pit is
filled, and so is it with a little evil,—and with good it is the
same. Little by little do good thoughts and deeds grow into
the Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By a man’s self is evil done, by himself he suffers, by himself
comes good, by himself purification, and by none other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the sole victory that brings gladness, for in the world
of forms victory breeds hatred for the conquered is unhappy.
He who has given up both victory and defeat, he is the taster
of bliss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I write and men read, but who can declare the wisdom of the
Lord? For as mists ascend at dawn so illusion was dispersed
before his radiance and the veil was lifted and men beheld
about them the true Universe of the Powers and the Truth,—the
One, the Alone, in which we live and move and have our
being.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVIII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>hus</span> have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet another thing, and heed it well for it was a day
precious as clean gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Lord went with his disciples, they came to the river
by the fields of Dhaniya the herdsman, a rich man who trusted
in his goods, but kindly and simple, such as the Blessed One
loved. And here he stayed his feet, smiling a little as at a
thought of his own; and his disciples stood about him, and he
said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we see great riches of beasts and pasture; surely the
man owning these good things is well content!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Dhaniya seeing the Holy One, drew near in his peasant’s
pride and addressed him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have boiled my rice, I have milked my cows,” so said the
herdsman Dhaniya. “I dwell near the banks of the Mahi, my
house is roofed, my fire kindled. Therefore, if thou wilt, rain,
O sky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For believing his riches a strong shield he feared nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am free from anger, free from stubbornness,” said the
Blessed One, “For one night I abide by the Mahi river. My
house is unroofed, the fire of passion is extinguished. Therefore,
if thou wilt, rain, O sky!” And he smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gadflies are not found with me,” said the herdsman
Dhaniya. “In meadows rich with grass my cows are roaming,
and well can they endure rain when it falls. Therefore if thou
wilt, rain, O sky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have made a raft, I have passed over to the shore of the
Peace,” so said the Blessed One. “Therefore if thou wilt, rain,
O sky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My wife is obedient!” boasted the herdsman Dhaniya.
“Winning she is, and I hear no ill of her. Therefore, if thou
wilt, rain, O sky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mind is obedient, delivered from all worldly matters,”
so said the Blessed One. “And in me there is no ill. Therefore
if thou wilt, rain, O sky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I support myself by my own riches!” so said the herdsman
Dhaniya, “and my children are healthy about me. I hear
nothing wicked of them. Therefore if thou wilt, rain, O sky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am no one’s servant,” so said the Perfect One, “with what
I have gained I wander through the world. For me there is
no need to serve. Therefore, if thou wilt, rain, O sky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have cows, I have calves!” so said the herdsman Dhaniya.
“I have also a bull as lord over the herds. Therefore if thou
wilt, rain, O sky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no cows, I have no calves!” so said the Happy One,
“—And I have no bull as lord over the herds. Therefore, if
thou wilt, rain, O sky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The stakes are driven in and cannot be shaken,” so said the
herdsman Dhaniya. “The ropes are new and well made: the
cows cannot break them. Therefore if thou wilt, rain, O
sky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having, like a bull, rent the ropes: having like an elephant
broken through the tangle,” so said the Blessed One, “I shall
no more be born to death. Therefore if thou wilt, rain, O
sky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he smiled as one at rest, enthroned above pain or change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then all at once, from a full-wombed cloud, a shower poured
down, filling both land and water. And the eyes of Dhaniya
were enlightened, and seeing the true riches of the empty hand
and freed soul, the herdsman spoke thus, bowing at the feet of
the Perfect One.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No small gain has indeed accrued to us since we have seen
the Blessed One. We take refuge in thee, O Wisest. Be thou
our Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He who has cows has care with his cows,” so said the
Blessed One, concluding the matter. “But he who is free of
these things has not care.” So Dhaniya entered the Way of
Peace, and taking the vow of the householder was at rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now in this of Dhaniya is a thing much to be pondered.
For it is observable that the Holy One said these words to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have passed over to Nirvana—to the Peace.” How could
this be and he yet living in the world of form? What then is
the Nirvana? For, since the departing of Him who has thus
Attained, the ignorant have taught the heresy which Sariputta
the Great rebuked in the monk Yamaka,—even that the true
Nirvana is extinction, is dispersal of all that once was the man,
the ego known to himself and others, he being annihilated in
death as a flame blown out in vast darkness. Yet no, and
again, not so, though not in words may the Truth be fully told.
Yet—if a man may attempt to throw a stone at a star, this that
follows may be told of the Nirvana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They who talk of existence and non-existence are ignorant,
for these are words only. There is no existence or non-existence,
but in their stead reality and unreality, and in this
world of form is unreality and in That World, reality. So
that the unreal ego which we here believe to be the man is
nothing and whether here or there has no reality but is a compound
of causes which dissolve at death, while the reality
of the man abides whether here or There. True it is that after
death no longer can it be perceived, no longer can it be guessed
by the bodily senses—the liars, the deceived, the slaves; yet in
a profundity beyond all depths of all oceans it abides. The
rest is silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the Blessed One and they who with him attained, were
in life delivered from the illusion of the world of forms and seeing
all as it is were glad. For the true Nirvana is an extinction—not
of the eternal—but of craving, the lust of the flesh, the
lust of life, and the pride of life. And when the inward fires
of lust, and hatred and pride are extinguished, then that man
has entered into the Nirvana whether here or there. And
surely this was the Lesson of Lessons, and many a parable,
many a teaching did the World-Honoured utter in all solemnity
that we might know it is the self—the individual self lurking
in a man like an ape in the boughs, clutching, greedy, foul,
foolish, that is the cause of all evil and sorrow and of his separation
from the universe of life and light that lies about him.
And he must learn that this foul and foolish chatterer is dream
and illusion of the senses and consciousness, for when this
teaching is mastered we lift the true eyes of wisdom and look
about us seeing at last that the world is wholly fair. Know
this, for it is the very kernel of the nut. This is the Way of
Peace, this is the Gate of the Ten Perfections whereby we also
are perfect being One; this is the Nirvana, absolute in joy
and bliss immortal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Be not misled. If this false belief of annihilation be accepted
the belief in the Karma and its awful justice falls to the
ground, and the Blessed One is made to utter words unreal
and deceptive. It is not well to traduce the teaching of the
Blessed One, for what he taught he knew, and where he was
silent it was from knowledge too great to be uttered save to
his high initiates, and they too, knowing, were content. For
a man can but receive as he is able, and the Truth needs two
servants—the one to speak and the other to hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True is it that the Lord before he passed away from the
world of the senses said to the beloved Ananda, this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have preached the truth, Ananda, and in respect of the
Truth He who has thus Attained had no such thing as the
closed fist of the Teacher who holds back his knowledge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, but a man can but take what he can, and where the
great saints of the Lord knew and were content, the lesser
men guessed and stumbled blindly by excess of light and this
was unavoidable for they were not prepared, and in future lives
they have learned, will learn, and they too be content in wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore when men ask the disciple of the Nirvana, and
say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it annihilation? Is it the end of all, for so many teach?”
reply thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the annihilation of ignorance and passion and all their
brood. It is the annihilation of conditioned being and of all
the illusion that fettered us. It is the rending of the painted
veil of life that hides from us the light. It is the end of all
turning of the wheel of the long pilgrimage through self-shaped
dream-worlds of deception. It is the end of grief and self-deceit.
It is awakening from the dream of life, from the crippling
of the ego-self, into freedom. It is beyond all that we
call life, and death is unknown to it. It is All and One and
above right and wrong and in it are all things reconciled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it is us and in us and we in it for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Open the eyes of understanding and see and know, as he
the Awakened, has taught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now must the story turn to the Princess Yashodara, released
from grief and grown strong in wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Musing night and day on these thoughts and this blessedness
the Princess excelled in knowledge and in her true eyes the
light shone brighter and more bright in the deep contemplation
of her heart, and when in the passing of the years the wealth
of the Maharaja fell into her hands she valued it nothing, placing
it where most good and least harm could flow from it.
And with attendant princesses she walked nearly five hundred
miles, refusing all offers of assistance, that she might be near
the World-Honoured, breathing the same air, sometimes attendant
upon his teaching, sometimes sending dutifully to enquire
after the health of the monk Rahula, her son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, having grown old, but still eminent in the nobility of her
beauty and its calm, as she sat alone one day she remembered
many of her friends who through the Peace here to be attained
had departed to that Other. And she thought this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was born on the same day as my lord, the Awakened
One, and in the regular order of things I should on the same
day enter the Great Peace. But this is an honour too great
for me and far beyond my deserts, nor can it be. I am now
seventy eight years in this world of illusion, and in two years
from now, he, the Blessed One, will enter that which cannot be
named. I will therefore request permission to precede him,
as the lower should precede the great.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, accompanied by her attendants, the Princess went to the
Vihara, the monastery, where the Lord sat at the time with a
company of disciples, and presenting herself before him humbly
asked forgiveness for any faults she might have committed.
And he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are the most virtuous of women. But from the time
you received the Light, you have done no marvels, so that
many have not known the power that is in you, doubting
whether you were indeed an Arhat. There is a company assembled
about us, who know not the Powers. Show them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Princess, doubting in her humility that this should
be, doubting whether a woman should display the beauty of
her person to onlookers, was not assured that this was well.
Yet, with the insight to which time is nothing, she spoke, rehearsing
the mystery and marvel of all her former lives, for
now having vanquished rebirth she was as the traveller who
nearing the mountain top and the eternal purities sees the way
by which he has come, rejoicing in perils escaped and rest unending.
And all sat entranced, listening to the music of her
voice and the marvels she—to whom time was no more than a
child’s toy cast aside—unfolded before them. And suddenly,
as she ended, the air upbore her light feet and a marvel was
done before them, for in the air she prostrated herself before
Him who has thus Attained, attributing to him the knowledge
that had guided her into bliss. And those who saw hid their
faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when all was concluded she retired to her own dwelling
and there, that same night, rising from contemplation to contemplation,
she beheld the Peace, being delivered for ever from
all illusion, and so passed into That which is to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And of her son—the monk Rahula—this also must be told:</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one time the Lord, with robe and bowl, went to Savatthi
in search of alms, and his son Rahula followed step for step,
and the Blessed One, turning, said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever form one bears, monk, is to be viewed with perfect
wisdom and the understanding—‘This is not mine; it is
not I. This is not my true self.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Rahula answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And only form, O Lord, and only form, O Happy One?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Form, Rahula, and sensation and perception and the tendencies
and consciousness. These also are not the true self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Rahula, being thus addressed with an Instruction, would
not go to roam and beg among the people, but set aside his
bowl, and sat beneath a tree to meditate upon the Instruction.
And in the evening, having ended his calm contemplation, he
sought the Blessed One and saluting him reverently seated
himself respectfully beside him and besought him to instruct
him on the discipline of meditation and training, and the
Blessed One instructed him in all the processes, even to the
ruling of the breath in inspiration and expiration so that the
false senses may be lulled and the true eye of wisdom opened,
and pleased and gladdened was the venerable Rahula with that
high instruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus Rahula in time became first a great warrior for the
Truth and then a great Arhat: a perfected saint. And in what
way did he become a warrior? Even as a monk asked of the
Awakened One:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Warriors, warriors, we call ourselves, O Happy One, and in
what way are we warriors?”, and had this reply:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We make war, monk. Therefore are we warriors?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And for what do we make war, O Leader?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For perfect virtue, for high endeavour, for sublime wisdom.
To see in a world of blindness, to be free in a world of slaves,—therefore,
do we make war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when is the victory gained?—When the dark night of
I-ness is enlightened,—when the man is no longer a swimmer
struggling for life in agony against the waves, but the grey
gull borne on the winds in bliss or floating at peace on the billows
of eternity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the victory of the monk Rahula and of the wise.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='pt4'>PART IV</h1></div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>S</span><span class='sc'>o</span> continued our Lord, wandering from place to place, or
resting in the season of the rains in the monasteries provided
by the supporters of the Brotherhood, and, followed
by his own, he taught the Breaking of the Fetters—and
the fetters he broke are these:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The delusion of self—namely that the individual ego is real
and self-existent. For what can exist outside the Universal
Self? And egoism is the very root of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doubt. For who can advance boldly, doubting the way
and where he shall set the next step?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belief in good works and ceremonies. For what good work
can open a man’s eyes if his motive is mean, and what value
have rites and ceremonies in themselves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fleshly lust. By no means did the Lord command a cruel
asceticism, for this he had tried to the uttermost and having
laid it aside, passed on. No, but a joyous temperance, the
child of wisdom and duty, the fosterer of endeavour. And
duty in all things, a strength by some to be attained now, by
others with patience in later lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ill-will. For this is a cruel fetter, biting to the very bone
of the wretch who carries it, and it is forged indeed from the
black iron of egoism and belief in the separate ego.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this being all accomplished the last fetters to be broken
are:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desire for separate and individual life in the world of
forms we see about us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desire for separate life in the formless world to which we
shall attain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pride—the very snarer of Divine Beings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Self-righteousness, the womb-sister of pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And last, the most terrible of fetters—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ignorance—mother of a deadly brood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And where he went these fetters fell before him, and prison
doors were opened and they who had sat in darkness walked in
light. And they aspired to perfection for he taught that Perfection
was their heritage, if not now, then in some future life
where the sown seeds of good expanding should throw out
strong arms and glorious blossom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they believed, and some set tottering steps in the path,
and some advanced with wings rather than feet, but all were
seekers and finders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he compelled none, nor threatened, for by a man’s
true self comes his salvation, and seated among his own he
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tathagata—He who has thus Attained, does not think
that it is he who must lead the Brotherhood or that the Order
is dependent upon him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only, steadfastly pointing the way, he rejoiced that men
should follow it, casting forth his light like the sun, not compelling
men to guide their steps by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did he teach resignation to sorrow nor its acceptance
as a blessing and discipline. Far from it. For in the clear
percipience of the Lord sorrow is ignorance and shameful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing only, monks, now as always I declare to you—sorrow
and the uprooting of sorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For what man would wander in the mist of sorrow when he
may walk glad and straight to the goal in the sunlight of wisdom.
And sorrow understood is sorrow ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore the Lord taught understanding of sorrow, as the
first need and therefore says the wise Nagasena:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a boy I was admitted to the Order, and nothing did I
know of the goal. But I thought—‘These men taught by the
Awakened One will teach me.’ And they taught, and now I
know with understanding the foundation and the crown of Renunciation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what the Lord taught he knew: that there is no sorrow
for the wise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus when he stayed at Alavi, by the cattle-path in the
forest he rested on a couch of leaves, and it so chanced that a
man of Alavi as he went through the forest saw the Exalted
One sitting absorbed in meditation, and greeting him with
respect this man sat down at his side and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Master, does the World-Honoured live happily?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Perfect One answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so, young man. Of those who live happily in the
world I also am one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cold, Master, is the winter night, the time of frost is coming:
rough is the ground trodden by cattle: thin is the couch of
leaves: light the monk’s yellow robe: sharp the cutting winter
wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For his heart pitied the aging of the Exalted One. But he
replied, again smiling:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so, young man. I live happily. Of those who live
happily in the world I also am one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was, and with his own also. For his mendicants
rejoicing said to one another:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We who call nothing our own, drenched with happiness, we
in this world cast out light like the radiant Gods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And their song was—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Abolished is the round of birth: Completed the ascetic life;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Done what was to do.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;This world of form is no more. This we know.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And sometimes proud and learned Brahmans would come
to dispute haughtily with the Perfect One, and they, full of
pride and anger, would rage and trip in their discourse thinking
to show their much learning rather than to seek the truth.
But like the waves of a muddy river lashing rock so were they,
and the Lord sat there always, answering duly, teaching duly,
clothed in serenity, his skin the colour of bright gold, his eyes
bright and calm, for he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That in disputation with anyone whatsoever I could be
thrown into any confusion or embarrassment,—there is no possibility
of such a thing, and because I know of no such possibility
I remain quiet and confident. And even when I am carried
here upon a bed shall my intellectual strength remain
unabated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his monks said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly from the Exalted One comes all our wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And because he was so near the Blessed One many monks
would come to the venerable Ananda and say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is long, brother, since we heard a discourse from the
Exalted One. It were very good if we might hear one now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, venerable ones, betake yourselves to the hermitage
of the Brahman Rammako. Perhaps you will get to hear a
discourse from the lips of the Exalted One.” For Ananda was
wise in the ways of the Master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now after the Perfected One had returned from his begging-round,
he turned and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Ananda, let us go to the East Grove, to the terrace
of the Mother of Migara, and stay there until the evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they went, and when he had finished his meditation he
turned to the venerable Ananda:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Ananda, let us to the Old Bath and refresh our
limbs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they went. Then the beloved Ananda addressed the Perfected
One thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hermitage of the Brahman Rammako, Master, is not
far from here. It is pleasantly situated in peaceful solitude.
Good were it if the Master should betake himself there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Blessed One signified by silence his assent. And
there they found many monks in edifying discourse. And he
waited till they were done, and cleared his throat and rapped at
the knocker, and they opened the door, and the World-Honoured
entered in and seated himself and incited and gladdened
them all with great and high discourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they got what they needed, for very wise was the beloved
Ananda in dealing with the Master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amazing indeed were the experiences of those who followed
the Lord, and not to be understood of those who have not stood
face to face with Truth and Love unveiled and terrible in
beauty, and terrible also in the loves they inspire. What can
words avail?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And where he went the Awakened One strewed little precepts
like flowers, easy for a child to remember yet each an upward
spiral on the Way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If all knew the fruits of alms-giving as I, monks, know them,
most surely they would not eat the last least mouthful without
dividing it with another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they answered, “Even so, Lord,” and gave of their food,
living in peace amidst the Transient, until even its semblance
should pass for ever away. And nothing else than food had
they to give, being monks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And one asked of the learned nun Dhammadhina:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how, venerable Lady,—how and what has the Blessed
One taught about the arising of the false ego in the beginning
of things? How came it to be? What does he teach of this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the lust of life that sows repeated being in successive
lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how is the annihilation of the false ego to be attained,
Venerable Lady? How has the Exalted One taught?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even by the complete annihilation, rejection, and driving
forth of the lust of life—this is what was taught by the Exalted
One.” So answered the nun Dhammadhina. “Even through
the breaking of any attachment to the Transient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of how Attachment began to be in the beginning of
things the Lord would not answer. The Way out, he taught;
the way in concerns not at all the man who is fleeing for his
life to peace and safety from attachment to the Transient and
its illusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what follows after death? What follows after the extinction
of illusion?” the seeker asked of the learned nun
Dhammadhina. And she replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Abandon the question, brother. I cannot grasp the meaning
of the question. If you will, go to the Enlightened One
and ask him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he went, and the Lord answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wise is Dhammadhina and mighty in understanding. My
answer is hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the Unknown cannot be known until the way is built to
it. Build then the way, and knowledge will come in time.
But, without words, to the few, the very few, this knowledge
has come, as has been told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the nun Gotami asked him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will the Exalted One teach me the very quintessence of the
Law,” he answered thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever teaching leads to passion and not to peace, to
pride and not to humility, to desire of much in place of little,
to love of society and not of solitude, to idleness and not to
striving, to a mind of unrest and not to a mind at peace—that,
O Gotami,—note well!—that is not the way,—that is
not the teaching of the Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as they sat in the calm of the sunset and discoursed,
Sariputta the Great said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I desire not life. I desire not death. I wait until my hour
shall come like a servant that waits for his wage. I await the
coming of the hour, conscious and of thoughtful mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus steadfast in the way they continued, not cruelly mortifying
the body but in the true asceticism of the heart that cannot
be tempted. For the Awakened One said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I teach asceticism inasmuch as I teach the burning away of
all evil conditions of the heart. And the true ascetic who thus
lives may fitly and rightly eat of the food that is given him in
alms, of rice pleasantly prepared and such-like, and it will do
him no ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So quietly and in radiance life went on as a summer day
which from dewy dawn passes through every gradation of light
until the night comes, taking the world in her net of stars and
laying all to rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still the Exalted One journeyed and taught, now being
very aged, and the seeds of his doctrine were carried as if by
far-flying birds into the outer lands which had never felt in this
life the tread of his blessed feet nor seen the calm of his face
nor the majesty that attended him. And taking root these
seeds shot up later into mighty trees of glorious growth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still he journeyed to and fro, and the people said to
the monks:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let not the World-Honoured overweary himself, for in
what are we worthy that our well-being should cost the world
its Light?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All he does is well. This also is well and could not be
otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the beloved Ananda saw with fear that the World-Honoured
moved more slowly and with more painful effort
on each journey he made. And awe and grief possessed Ananda,
seeing this, for he had not as yet attained to perfect enlightenment,—and
with many cares he compassed the Blessed
and followed him wherever he went.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>THE LAST JOURNEY</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span><span class='sc'>nd</span> the Blessed One passed through Pataligama and
went on to the river and at that time Ganges was
swollen and brimming, and some with him began to
seek for boats and some for basket-rafts that they might pass
over. But the Exalted One, swiftly as a powerful man could
stretch out his arm and withdraw it, vanished from the hither
side of the river and stood on the other bank with the brethren.
And he uttered this verse:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Those who cross the stormy sea</p>
<p class='line0'>Making a firm way for their feet,</p>
<p class='line0'>While the blinded tie their basket-rafts,</p>
<p class='line0'>These are the wise, these are the safe and glad.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And they passed on to the villages of Nadika and at the last
the Happy One rested at the Brick Hall, and the beloved Ananda
(who tended him always) came and sat down respectfully
beside him, and having passed through the village and heard of
the deaths of several devout followers, men and women, who
had followed them formerly, he asked the Lord of their destiny
and of what had befallen them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And naming them each and all by name, replied the Exalted
One:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of those men and women there are some who in their first
return to this world will make an end of sorrow and illusion
and return no more. And some there are for whom having attained
the highest knowledge, it is no longer possible that they
should return to mortal birth, for they are now assured of final
salvation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in the Brick Hall at Nadika he taught the people, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great is the fruit, great the advantage of earnest contemplation
when adorned with right doing. And great the fruit
of high intellect adorned with earnest contemplation. For the
mind set round with intelligence is thus delivered from sensuality,
from the false ego, from delusion and ignorance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they went on to Vaisali, and from thence to Beluva, and
there the Blessed One rested in the village. And he said to
the brethren:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mendicants, do you take up your abode round about Vaisali
for the rains, each according to his friends. For I shall
enter upon the rainy season here at Beluva.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So be it, Lord,” said the brethren in assent, and so it was
done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now when the Blessed One had thus entered on the rains at
Beluva there fell upon him a sickness, and sharp pains came
upon him even to death. But mindful and self-possessed he
bore them without complaint. And this thought came into his
mind:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would not be right for me to pass away without addressing
the disciples, without taking leave of the Order. Let me
now by a strong effort of the will bend down this sickness and
keep my hold on life until the allotted time be come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he bent that sickness down and it abated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he began to recover he went out of the little vihara—the
monastery, and sat down behind it on a seat spread out
for him. And the venerable Ananda went where the Blessed
One was, and sat respectfully beside him, and said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seen, Lord, how the Blessed One suffered, and
though at that sight my body became weak as a creeper, yet I
had some little comfort in thinking that the Blessed One would
not pass from existence until at least he had left some instructions
touching the Order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What then, Ananda? Does the Order expect that of me?
Now, He who has thus Attained thinks not that it is he who
shall lead the Order or that it is dependent upon him. I too,
Ananda, am now grown old and full of years. My journey is
drawing to its close. I have reached my sum of days, I am
turning eighty years of age. And just as a worn-out cart can
only with much additional care be made to move, so, I think,
the body of the Tathagata can only be kept going with much
additional care. It is only when ceasing to attend to any
outward thing he becomes plunged in devout meditation concerned
with no material object,—it is only then that the body
of the Tathagata is at ease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was a long pause, and the venerable Ananda remained
steadfastly gazing at the Perfect One, absorbed in his
words as foreseeing the end. And the Lord resumed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Therefore, Ananda, be lamps unto yourselves. Betake
yourselves to no external Refuge. Hold fast to the truth as a
lamp. Look not for refuge to anyone beside yourselves. And
whoever after I am dead shall be a lamp unto themselves and
holding fast to the truth look for refuge to no one outside
themselves, it is they, among my mendicants, who shall reach
the Height.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again the Blessed One robed himself early in the morning
and taking his bowl went into Vaisali for alms and when he
returned he sat down upon the seat prepared for him and when
he had finished eating the rice he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take up the mat, Ananda,—I will go to spend the day at
the Kapila Ketiya.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So be it, Lord,” said the venerable Ananda, and he followed
step for step behind the Blessed One.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he had come there the Blessed One sat down upon
the mat spread out for him, and the venerable Ananda took his
seat respectfully beside him. And the Blessed One said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoever, Ananda, has developed himself and ascended to
the very heights of the four paths to Power, thus transcending
bodily conditions and using these Powers for good may if he
desires it, remain in the same birth for an age, or that portion
of the age which is yet to run. Now He who has thus Attained
has developed these Powers and could therefore live on
yet for an age or that portion of the age which has yet to run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even though this suggestion was given by the Blessed
One, the venerable Ananda did not comprehend it, nor did he
say, “Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain! Live on for the good and
happiness of the peoples, out of pity for the world and the weal
of Divine Beings and men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a second time did the Blessed One say this, and yet did
not the beloved Ananda speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Blessed One addressed him thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may leave me, Ananda, for awhile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And rising from his seat, Ananda saluted the Lord, and sat
down at the foot of a tree not far off, and when he was gone,
the Evil One, the Tempter, approached the Lord and stood
beside him, and he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pass away now, Lord, from existence. Let the Blessed
One die. For did he not say that when the Order was established,
and the lay-people, and the truth made known, that then
the time would be come? And all this is now done, and the
time is here. Pass away now, therefore, Lord. Let the
Blessed One die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he had spoken, the Blessed One said to the Evil
One:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be happy. At the end of three months from this time the
Blessed One will die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus did the Lord deliberately and consciously reject the
rest of his possible sum of life. And there followed an earthquake
and tremblings and thunders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Ananda returned in haste and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful and marvellous is this earthquake, Lord, and
what is its cause?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Lord said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of the eight causes of earthquake and tremblings, this is
one—when an Awakened One,—He who has thus Attained,
consciously and deliberately rejects the remainder of his life,
then is the earth shaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, still speaking of the mastery of the Powers, the Lord
continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I call to mind, Ananda, how when I used to enter into
an assembly of many hundred nobles with discourse of religion
I would instruct and gladden them, and they would say,—‘Who
may this be who thus speaks? A man or a God?’ And
having taught and gladdened them, suddenly I would vanish
away. But they knew me not even when I vanished away, and
they would say in bewilderment, ‘Who may this be who has
thus vanished away? A man, or a God?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he spoke also of the eight stages of deliverance from
errors of perception, passing beyond the apprehension of form
through infinite space and infinite reason and finally beyond
sensation and ideas, even into the eighth stage of deliverance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And having given this instruction the Lord related to the
venerable Ananda how that in three months’ time he should
hear his voice no more, and the venerable Ananda cried out
vehemently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vouchsafe, O Blessed One, to live. Stay with us for the
weal of Divine Beings and men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Lord answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The time for making such a request is past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a second and a third time Ananda entreated and the
Lord replied, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Verily, the word has gone forth from Him who has thus
Attained. That the Tathagata for the sake of living should
repent of that saying can in no wise be. Come, Ananda, let us
rise and go to the Mahavana.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they went to the Mahavana, to the Service Hall, and
he commanded Ananda to assemble there such of the brethren
as dwelt in the neighbourhood of Vaisali. And when they were
assembled the Blessed One sat down upon his mat and addressed
them. And he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The truths, monks, which I have made known to you and
you have mastered, these practise, meditate, and spread abroad,
that it may continue to be for the good and happiness of great
multitudes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold, monks, now I exhort you. All component things
must grow old and pass away. Work out your salvation with
diligence. At the end of three months from this time He who
has thus Attained will die. My age is now full ripe: my life
draws to its close. I leave you, I depart, relying on myself
alone. Be earnest, holy, full of thought. Be steadfast in
resolve. Keep watch over your own hearts. Who wearies
not, but holds fast to the Law, shall cross this sea of life, shall
make an end of grief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he spoke, and they dispersed silently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Blessed One robed himself early in the morning
and took his bowl and went into Vaisali for alms and when he
had eaten his meal and was returning, he gazed steadfastly at
Vaisali and he said this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the last time, Ananda, that He who has thus Attained
will behold Vaisali. Let us now go to Bhandagama.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they went, and the Lord rested in the village itself, and
there he addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is through ignorance of the Truths that we have had to
run so long, to wander so far in this weary road of rebirth—you
and I. But when the noble conduct of life, noble meditation,
noble wisdom and noble freedom are realized and known,
then is the craving for existence rooted out, the chain broken
and we return to earth no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was there also that he delivered the high discourse on
the nature of the Four Truths; and having done this he pressed
on with the venerable Ananda and a great company of his own
to Pava. And there he stayed in the Mango Grove of Chunda,
and Chunda was a smith by family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Chunda heard that the Perfect One had come to
Pava and rested in his Mango Grove, he went to him and saluted
him joyfully, and with reverence took his seat beside him,
and the Blessed One gladdened him with talk of high things.
And, so gladdened, he addressed the Lord, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May the Blessed One do me the honour of taking his meal,
together with the brethren, at my house to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Lord signified by silence his consent, and seeing
he had consented, Chunda the worker in metals, bowed before
him and keeping him on his right hand, departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at the end of the night Chunda made ready in his house
excellent food, hard and soft, sweet rice and cakes and the
food, found in the earth and loved by boars, truffles, and when
all was ready he announced it to the Lord saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exalted One, the meal is ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Blessed One robed himself and took his bowl and
he and his followers went to the dwelling-place of Chunda.
And when the meal was over, he gladdened the smith with discourse
of high matters, and so rose and departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after the Blessed One had eaten of his food then fell
upon him a grievous disease, and sharp pain came upon him
even to death, but he bore it without complaint mindful and
self-possessed. And to the venerable Ananda he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, let us go to Kusinara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so, Lord,” said the venerable Ananda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they went, but as they went the Blessed One grew very
weary and he rested beneath a tree and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fold the robe and spread it for me, I pray you. I am
weary, Ananda, and I must rest awhile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the robe was spread, folded fourfold, and when the
World-Honoured was seated he asked for fresh water to drink
and Ananda answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Lord, five hundred carts have just gone by across the
stream and stirred up by the wheels it has become fouled and
turbid. Let us wait for the river, cool and transparent, easy
to get into. There the Blessed One may drink and cool his
limbs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his thirst would not wait, and taking a bowl Ananda
went down to the stream, and when he came to it it flowed clear
as light. And he thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How wonderful, how marvellous is the power of Him who
has thus Attained. For this turbid stream is flowing brightly
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he returned he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great is the power of the Lord. Let the Happy One
drink!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now at that time a young man named Pukkusa, a disciple of
the Brahman Alara, passed along the highway, and seeing the
Blessed One very weary beneath the tree he came and saluted
him taking his seat respectfully beside him, and the Holy One
discoursed with him on the depths of calm in pure contemplation
and abstraction of mind from the vain shows about us,
and with every power of his mind and heart did the young man
listen, and when the great teaching was ended, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most excellent, Lord, are the words of your mouth—most
excellent. As it were to bring a lamp into the darkness so
are your words. And I, even I, betake myself to the Blessed
One as my refuge, to the Truth and the Brotherhood. May I
be accepted as a disciple!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the young Pukkusa presented two robes of burnished
cloth of gold to the World-Honoured, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May favour be shown and these accepted at my hand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case, Pukkusa, offer the one to me and the other to
Ananda.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was done and the young man gladdened and
strengthened, rose and bowed down and went his way.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXI</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>N</span><span class='sc'>ow</span> not long after the young man was gone the venerable
Ananda placed that glorious robe upon the
Blessed One, and so placed it appeared to dim and
lose its splendour, and Ananda said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, it is marvellous that the colour of the skin of the
Blessed One should now be so clear, so bright, beyond measure,
for this robe of burnished gold has lost its splendour in the
radiance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is even so, Ananda. For on the night that He who has
thus Attained achieves supreme Enlightenment and also on
the night in which he passes away for ever leaving no residue
behind, the colour of his person becomes exceedingly bright
and clear. And now this day at the third watch of the night
at Kusinara, between the twin sala trees the utter passing away
of Him who has thus Attained will take place. Come, let us
go forward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he was come to the Mango Grove by the river, he
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fold a robe for me, Kundaka, for I am forespent and
would lie down.” And it was done and the Blessed One laid
himself down on his right side, and meditated, calm and self-possessed,
and finally, calling to Ananda the beloved, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now it may happen that someone may grieve Chunda the
smith, saying, ‘it is evil to you, Chunda, and loss, that the
Blessed One died after he had eaten his last meal from your
provision.’ But check this remorse, Ananda, by saying—‘It
is good and gain to you, Chunda, that this should have been.
For the very mouth of the Blessed One has told me this—There
is laid up for Chunda the smith a good Karma of long
life and good fortune and good fame and the inheritance of
Heaven and sovereign power.’ In this manner check any remorse
in Chunda the smith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then once more rising, the World-Honoured began again his
pilgrimage of pain, and he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, let us go to the Sala Grove of the Malla people at
Kusinara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So with the monks the Exalted One reached at last the Sala
Grove of the Mallas, and he desired that Ananda the beloved
would lay a couch for him with its head to the north between
the twin sala trees that they knew. And this was done, and
the sala trees shed their dropping blossoms on the body of the
Blessed One, for so it must be with a departing Buddha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here, Ananda seeing that the time drew on, reverently
besought the commands of the Lord as to the disposal of his
mortal body. And he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hinder not yourselves by honouring what remains of Him
who has thus Attained. Be zealous, I beseech you, in your
own behalf: be intent on good. There are wise men among the
nobles who will do due honour to the body of the Tathagata.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he heard this Ananda could no longer endure his
grief, and that the Lord might not see his tears, he went into
the monastery and stood leaning against the door and wept, for
he thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! I still remain but a learner, one who has not yet
attained perfection, and the Master is about to pass away from
me—he who is so kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Blessed One called the brethren and asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where then, monks, is Ananda?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they told him, and he said to a certain brother:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, brother, and say ‘Brother Ananda, the Master calls
you.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was done and the beloved Ananda returned, and the
Blessed One said to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough, Ananda. Do not let yourself be troubled. Do
not weep. Have I not often told you that it is in the very nature
of things most near and dear to us that we must divide
ourselves from them and leave them? How then could it be
possible that anything containing within itself the necessity of
dissolution should not be dissolved? For a long time, Ananda,
have you been very near to me by acts of love, kind and good,
that never varies and is beyond all measure. And not only
by acts but by words and thoughts of love. You have done
well, Ananda. Be earnest in effort and you too shall soon be
delivered and attain the perfect percipience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Blessed One said to the others:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a wise man, monks, is Ananda. Knowing what is
right he has four marvellous qualities, for those who see him,
who hear him speak or teach are filled with joy on beholding
and hearing him, and the company of the Assembly are ill at
ease when Ananda is silent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And later he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go now, Ananda, to the town of Kusinara and inform the
people of the Mallas that in the last watch of the night He
who has thus Attained will pass away. And say this—‘Be
favourable herein, Mallas, and leave no occasion to reproach
yourselves that you did not visit the World-Honoured in his
last hours.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Ananda the beloved went, robed and carrying his bowl
and attended by a member of the Order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, as it chanced, the Mallas were assembled in the Council
Hall and when they heard his words, they wept, they and
their wives and children saying:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Too soon will the Blessed One die!</p>
<p class='line0'>Too soon will the Happy One pass away.</p>
<p class='line0'>Too soon will the Light of the World be darkened!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And trooping out with their wives and children, these Mallas
came to the Grove of the sala trees, and Ananda considering
their great number thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is not time that they should speak singly with the
Lord. But I will present them by families.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this he did, causing the Mallas to stand in groups and
so presented them, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, a Malla of such and such a name, with his wives, his
children his retinue and his friends, humbly bows down at the
feet of the Blessed One.” And that family with its retinue
then advanced, weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after this manner were all presented during the first
watch of the night, and when it was done they retired in heavy
grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was yet one work of mercy left unto the Lord.
For at this time a mendicant named Subaddha was dwelling at
Kusinara, and he heard the news that the Blessed One was
about to pass away and his religious doubts rushed into his
mind and he thought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seldom indeed in this world do the authentic Buddhas appear.
I have faith in the monk Gotama that he may be able to
remove my uncertainty. I will go to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he went and told his case to Ananda and he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough, friend Subaddha. Do not trouble Him who has
thus Attained. The Lord is weary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And three times he refused. But the Lord heard and he
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him come to me. He will ask from a true desire of
knowledge and will quickly understand my replies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Ananda said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enter in, friend Subaddha. The Blessed One gives you
leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And speaking respectfully that mendicant put his questions,
awaiting the answer with anxiety. And it was this: “Is the
Way of the Law the only path possible for a saint? Can that
way alone produce sainthood of the first order?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Lord replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfect saints from the first to the fourth degree are found
only in the Noble Eightfold Path.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he had given the reason why only under such
discipline is perception perfected, Subaddha, hailing his words
with gladness, every doubt lost in light, besought admission as
a disciple and it was granted and the probation of four months
remitted, though Subaddha himself willingly undertook that
probation. But the Lord said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this case I acknowledge the difference in persons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was the last man the Lord himself received. And
because it could not be otherwise Subaddha attained light and
percipience, and became conscious that for him birth was at an
end, and he became a great Arhat. And he sat beside the
Blessed One until the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the time drew on swiftly and knowing this, the
Blessed One said, while they all stood in great grief surrounding
him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be, Ananda, that in some of you the thought may
arise—‘Now that the word of the Master is ended we have no
Teacher.’ But this is not so. The truths and the rules of the
Order—let them be your Teacher when I am gone. And when
I am gone, Ananda, let the Order if it will, abolish the Lesser
Precepts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after awhile the Blessed One spoke again, and he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be, brethren, that there is doubt or misgiving in the
mind of some brother as to the Buddha, the Truth, the Way.
Enquire freely, monks! Do not reproach yourself afterwards
with the thought,—‘We were face to face with the Blessed
One, and yet could not bring ourselves to enquire.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the brethren were silent. And again and a third time
the Lord repeated this. And in his care for them he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be that the brethren will not question out of reverence
for the Teacher. Let one friend then communicate with
another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still they were silent, and the venerable Ananda said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is wonderful, Lord. I have faith to believe that in this
whole Assembly of the brethren there is not one who has any
doubt or misgiving as to the Buddha, the Truth, or the Way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Blessed One, sinking yet lower into weakness,
answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the fulness of faith do you speak, Ananda. But He
who has thus Attained knows of certain knowledge that in this
whole Assembly there is not one brother who has any doubt or
misgiving. For even the most backward of all these brethren
knows and has seen and will be born no more in a state of
suffering and is assured of final peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And by these words did the World-Honoured reassure
Ananda the beloved in whom as yet the tenderness of love crippled
its wings, restraining it from the eagle-flight of the perfected
Arhat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Ananda knelt, hiding his face beside the sala trees where
lay the Blessed One, for he knew that the parting drew very
near. And there was a deep silence, and it was as though all
the spirits of earth and air, and the Divine Beings and the
Three Worlds, the earth, the heavens, and hells waited with
them nor would lose a breath that remained. And He who has
thus Attained lay with closed eyes, submerged in calm as in a
great ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after awhile his eyelids opened and for the last time he
looked upon them and for the last time his disciples heard his
voice, strong in death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold now, brethren, I exhort you, saying—‘Decay is inherent
in all component things. Work out your own salvation
with diligence.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they trembled, kneeling about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Blessed One entered into the first state of ecstasy,
and, rising from this, into the second, and so passed into the
third and into the fourth and rising from that realm of ecstasy
he entered the realm of the infinity of space, and from this he
entered the realm of the infinity of consciousness and rising
from this he entered the realm of nothingness, and beyond this
the realm of neither perception nor non-perception, and from
this he arrived at the cessation of sensation and idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Ananda cried out to the great Anuruddha in an agony:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O my Lord—O Anuruddha, the Blessed One is dead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he, leaning above that Peace, said with calm:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, brother Ananda. He has entered that state where
sensation and ideas have ceased to be.”</p>

<hr class='tbk100'/>

<p class='pindent'>And all veiled their faces.</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>And the mind of Him who has thus Attained retraced its
way downward again and passing through all the stages entered
into the fourth stage of deep meditation and passing out
of this he immediately entered the Great Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at the moment of his expiring the thunders of Heaven
broke forth roaring about them and there was a loud and terrible
trembling of the earth and the voice of Him who is the
First uttered this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All beings in the world must lose their compound selves
and individuality, and even such a Master as this, he, unrivalled
and endued with all the powers, even he has passed
into the Nirvana.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the voice of Indra, King of Gods, took up the tale.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Transient are all component things.</p>
<p class='line0'>They being born must die, and being</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;dead are glad to be at rest.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And Anuruddha the Great said these words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When he, the Desireless, lay in peace, so ending his span
of life, resolute and with unshaken mind did he endure the
pains of death, attaining his final deliverance from the Fetters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ananda cried aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there was terror, then the hair rose on the head, when
he who possessed all grace—the supreme Buddha died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus spoke the Four Loves, from the highest to the lowest,—and
these of the brethren who were not yet enfranchised
from the passions wept and wailed in anguish, crying aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too soon has the Blessed One died. Too soon has the
Happy One departed. Too soon is the World’s Light darkened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the great Arhats bore their sorrow calm and self-possessed,
saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Transient are all earth’s things. How is it possible they
should not be dissolved?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all that night did the great Sariputta and Anuruddha
spend in high discourse but Ananda wept nor could be comforted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in the morning the great Anuruddha addressed the sorrowing
Assembly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough, my brethren. Weep not nor lament. Has not
the Blessed One declared to us that it is in the very nature of
things near and dear to us that we and they must part? How
then can it be possible that anything born and thus containing
within itself the necessity of dissolution should not dissolve?
Weep no more. Even the spirits would reproach us. For
they who have attained wisdom say ‘Transient indeed are all
component things. How is it possible they should not be dispersed?
This cannot be.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And calling to Ananda he sent him into the town of Kusinara
that he might tell the faithful Mallas that their Lord was departed
and that in their true hands should be the burning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they came out lamenting, having made great and costly
preparation, and they encased the body of the Lord in new
cloth and folded sheets of wool and lastly in a vessel of iron
for the burning, and having clad themselves in new garments
eight chieftains of the Mallas lifted the body, and they bore
it through their little town to their own shrine, and there in
the presence of the Order with devotion and spices and flowers
and perfumes they did what was needful, and the body of the
Lord passed into grey ash, fulfilling all even to the uttermost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bow down with clasped hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard, hard is it to meet with a Buddha through hundreds
of ages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they knew in whose presence they had stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This also have I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great Ananda, casting aside the fetters of love and retaining
only its radiance, became a mighty Arhat and laid aside
all sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After these things, one day it so chanced that one of the
brothers sat with Pingiya the aged Brahman, the disciple of
the Lord, and Pingiya from the fulness of his heart spoke of
the Blessed One, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As he saw the Way, so he taught it, he, the very wise, the
passionless, the desireless Lord, and how should he do otherwise,
for in him was no shadow nor turning of untruth. I will
praise the voice of him who was without folly, who had left
arrogance far behind. It is he only, the Dispeller of darkness,
the high Deliverer, who giveth light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And seeing his love, the other said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How then can you stay away from him even one instant,
O Pingiya?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the old man replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even for one instant do I stay away from him, my
brother. Vigilant day and night I see him in my mind. In
reverencing him do I spend the night, and verily I think I am
not far from him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he mused awhile and added this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am worn out and feeble, but my heart, venerable brother,
is joined to him for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And lo, as Pingiya sat and said this word, there shone about
them a great light and Pingiya beheld the Blessed One stand
there in majesty that cannot be uttered. And he said these
words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strong is thy faith, O Pingiya, and it shall be made glad.
Fear not. You too shall reach that further shore, the haven
of the realm of death.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span><span class='sc'>nd</span> when the burning was done, the faithful Mallas
gathered the bones and they took them to their Council
Hall and surrounded them with a lattice-work of
spears and a rampart of bows, and there for seven days they
did them reverence and homage with solemn dance and music
and garlands and perfumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the King of Maghada sent to beg a portion of the relics,
for he said: “The Blessed One was of the soldier caste and so
too am I; I am worthy to receive a portion and I will set
over it a sacred monument and hold a solemn feast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And other peoples, and among them the Sakyas of Kapila,—the
Lord’s own people—sent demanding each a portion. And
the Sakyas said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He who has thus Attained was the pride of our race. We
are worthy to receive a portion, and we will put up a sacred
monument and celebrate a solemn feast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was with six more peoples all demanding their
portion, and the true Mallas grew angry, for they loved the
Lord, and they replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Blessed One died in our land and he is ours. We will
not give away any of the relics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the wise Brahman Dona rose amongst them and said
this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear, sirs, one word from me. Our Lord taught forbearance,
and gentleness was the law of his lips. Would it
not be unseemly that strife should arise over the relics of
him who was in all things highest? Sirs, let us all with one
accord unite in friendly harmony to divide these precious relics
into eight portions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they asked him, this being so, to undertake the division,
and he answered “Be it so,” and with scrupulous care he
divided the relics, asking for himself the vessel that he might
set a monument over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to the Moriya people (who too late asked their share
of the precious relics), seeing their grief they gave the embers
of the pyre, and these with all reverence they took away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus is the story told of Him who cast aside earthly love
and riches and power that he might open the way to the
myriads of mankind who have trodden it after him and who
will tread it until all things merge in the unity and reconcilement
of the Peace. For like a bright shining went forth the
words of the Lord unto the ends of the earth, and those
countries that have not heard shall yet hear and rejoice, for in
Him were all wisdom and all love. And Kings and Emperors
have heard and adored, and peasants looked up in gladness
to see the night of sorrow dawn into the sunrise of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And for that man who desires no longer the illusions of earth,
ended—ended is the passing from death to death, the illusion
of that false self and ego being slain over whom alone death has
dominion! For the All in whom we are One is life and not
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet do not think that all the appearances of this world are
wholly illusion for that was not the Teaching of the Lord.
No; but he taught that the five senses cannot see nor hear
nor touch nor the dissolving brain apprehend Absolute Truth,
and that this being so there is only relative truth for those
unenlightened who see but as in a glass darkly, while those
who have attained enlightenment, as did He who has thus
Attained, behold the Truth face to face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore here we see things but as they can appear to us
and not in their true Being, and are most mistaken and
deceived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore it is a strange thing and not to be uttered in
words how by following the narrow way of right thinking and
right doing is the cleansed perception attained. But the Lord
said: “Do thus and thus, and you shall know.” And so it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to the weak and poor in spirit as to the great of mind
he did not say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Believe this, for so it is told you” but “Do this, and little
by little, as when a man climbs a mountain the earth unfolds
beneath him, for yourselves you shall see and know, needing
no testimony from another—No, not even from the ancient
scriptures, the Vedas, the Vedanta or any Brahman nor another.
For the Kingdom of Heaven is within you. Look
inward and see it and be glad.” Thus the Lord taught and
so it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And because this is so I who have seen many teachings of
the old writings and of the Brahmans pass away in later
knowledge have never seen one jot or one tittle of the Law pass
rebuked into oblivion, neither shall I, nor any other. Knowledge
is a good thing and a great, but all knowledge that comes
through the brain and the five senses shall be rebuked later
or sooner by the majesty of the Truth and shall crumble and
pass. Only he who perceives beyond knowledge and sees beyond
sight can apprehend these matters and so sit above error,
being one with the One, and beyond that is the Nirvana, and
even beyond the Nirvana it may well be there are states inconceivable
in glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the ignorant, nothing is as they think it and they
move through a world of distorted forms most alien to the
Truth, just as in the lower consciousness of insect, reptile, and
beast the forms perceived by them are still more alien from the
Truth, for consciousness evolves from lowly beginnings. And
this must be so since the thing seen is shaped by him who sees
it through his own fettered consciousness, the limits of which
he can in no way escape until he reaches that perception to
which the perception of the ignorant is as the snail’s or worm’s
to the man’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet let us not think that Reality is far from us. It lies
about and in us and we walk in it and see it not, and in the
higher perception bright things move about us and we of
the lower perception see them no more than the blind man
the sunshine in which he sits, and they touch us with strange
instincts and visitings through the dark and we do not know,
and our heart calls them to come nearer and there is silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear, the
Blessed One summed up all teachings of the wise men of old
and those who are yet to come, and no more can be added
to it though it shall be more clearly understood as time and
knowledge join hands. Therefore walk in the Way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And whereas there are wise men of the West who teach that
there is but one life in this world of form and illusion, one
hope of development and knowledge,—I say this: Very wise
and near the Truth must be those men of the West if one life
of twenty, thirty, ninety years suffices to free them from the
fetters of ignorance and render them perfect as their Father in
Heaven (for so they phrase it) is perfect. With us this is not
so, nor yet do we hold that any of the Buddhas can pay the
debt of another nor lift his sins from his shoulders, holding
that the debt incurred must be paid by the debtor, and this for
the sake of immortal Justice and for his own sake also. For
the Law is evolution in the innermost as in the mortal body.
First the lowly beginning, the seed in black earth. Then the
tender shoot, the waxing strength of trunk and bough till they
can bear the glory of expanding blossom, and last, the perfect
fruit. And in one life this cannot be. And so have all the
Buddhas taught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet another thing. It was said by our Wisest that the man
who truly perceives sits above good and evil and may do what
he will. Is this a hard saying? How can it be?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is because the Truth is now his will. It is his being; he
sits in it and it in him, and the Truth and he are one. How
should such a man think; “This is right. I will do it. This
is evil; I will not do it,” any more than he will think; “I must
breathe or I shall die,” considering each breath or heart-beat?
How can sin draw him any more than the writhing of the
snake tempts to imitation the man who walks erect? These
things are the necessary laws of the beginner in the Way.
They are stages of the Noble Eightfold Path, but for the
Enlightened, they who see things as they are, laws have no
meaning, for they themselves are Law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this is the faith that must triumph, for Wisdom is its
sceptre and Knowledge its footstool, and the science of the
schools its slave to follow where it has led the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did not the Blessed One say—“We know. He who has thus
Attained has nothing to do with theories.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And great is the patience of the Law, for Eternity is its own
and of time it knows nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now in ending I write down a few maxims which the
wise have made for those who did not see the Face nor hear
the Voice of Him who has thus Attained, that they also may
consider and attain. For these are steps on the Way. “Let
a man learn to comprehend the True Nature of the World of
Law. Then will he perceive that all things are but the production
of Mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In all living creatures there exists and has existed from
the beginning the nature of the Law. All, by this nature, contain
the original essence of Enlightenment. Wherefore birth
and death and even the Nirvana itself are transcended and become
for us a dream of the night that is gone, being lost in a
greater Light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the eye of flesh, plants and trees appear to be gross
matter. But to the eye of the Buddha they are composed of
minute spiritual particles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grass, trees, countries, the earth itself, all these shall wholly
enter into Enlightenment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hail to the Buddhas of the Three Worlds, who are all but
One in the One Mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With lips of clay have I told that which cannot be uttered
and with mortal thought have I set forth the Highest. And
well I knew this could not be, for it is above the flesh and the
tongue cannot speak it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glory to the Blessed One, the Holy, the Perfect in Enlightenment!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
